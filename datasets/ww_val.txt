 the mind strong fancies work, 
A deep delight the bosom thrills, 
Oft as I pass along the fork 
Of these fraternal hills : 
Where, save the rugged road, we find 
No appanage of human kind, 
Nor hint of man ; if stone or rock 
Seem not his handy- work to mock 
By something cognizably shaped ; 



Mockery — or model roughly hewn, 
And left as if by earthquake strewn, 
Or from the Flood escaped : 
Altars for Druid service fit ; 
(But where no fire was ever lit, 
Unless the glow-worm to the skies 
Thence offer nightly sacrifice) 
Wrinkled Egyptian monument ; 
Green moss-grown tower ; or hoary tent ; 
Tents of a camp that never shall be razed— 
On which four thousand years have gazed ! 
n. 
Ye plough-shares sparkling on the slopes ! 
Ye snow-white lambs that trip 
Imprisoned 'mid the formal props 
Of restless ownership ! 
Ye trees, that may to-morrow fall 
To feed the insatiate Prodigal ! 
Lawns, houses, chattels, groves, and fields, 
All that the fertile valley shields ; 
Wages of folly — baits of crime, 
Of life's uneasy game the stake, 
Playthings that keep the eyes awake 
Of drowsy, dotard Time ; — 
care ! guilt ! — vales and plains, 
Here, 'mid his own unvexed domains, 
A Genius dwells, that can subdue 
At once all memory of You, — 
Most potent when mists veil the sky, 
Mists that distort and magnify ; 
While the coarse rushes, to the sweeping breeze. 
Sigh forth their ancient melodies ! 
in. 
List to those shriller notes ! — that march 
Perchance was on the blast, 
When, through this Height's inverted arch, 
Rome's earliest legion passed ! 
— They saw, adventurously impelled, 
And older eyes than theirs beheld, 
This block — and yon, whose church-like frame 
Gives to this savage Pass its name. 
Aspiring Road ! that lov'st to hide 
Thy daring in a vapoury bourn, 
Not seldom may the hour return 
When thou shalt be my guide : 
And I (as all men may find cause, 
When life is at a weary pause, 
And they have panted up the hill 
Of duty with reluctant will) 
Be thankful, even though tired and faint, 
For the rich bounties of constraint ; 
Whence oft invigorating transports flow 
That choice lacked courage to bestow ! 



TO ENTERPRISE. 

 

My Soul was grateful for delight 
That wore a threatening brow ; 
A veil is lifted — can she slight 
The scene that opens now ? 
Though habitation none appear, 
The greenness tells, man must be there ; 
The shelter — that the perspective 
Is of the clime in which we live ; 
Where Toil pursues his daily round ; 
Where Pity sheds sweet tears — and Love, 
In woodbine bower or birchen grove, 
Inflicts his tender wound. 
— Who comes not hither ne'er shall know 
How beautiful the world below ; 
Nor can he guess how lightly leaps 
The brook adown the rocky steeps. 
Farewell, thou desolate Domain ! 
Hope, pointing to the cultured plain, 
Carols like a shepherd-boy ; 
And who is she \ — Can that be Joy ! 
Who, with a sunbeam for her guide, 
Smoothly skims the meadows wide ; 
While Faith, from yonder opening cloud, 
To hill and vale proclaims aloud, 
" Whate'er the weak may dread, the wicked dare, 
Thy lot, Man, is good, thy portion fair !" 
. 

TO ENTERPRISE. 

Keep for the Young the impassioned smile 
Shed from thy countenance, as I see thee stand 
High on that chalky cliff of Briton's Isle, 
A slender volume grasping hi thy hand — 
(Perchance the pages that relate 
The various turns of Crusoe's fate) — 
Ah, spare the exulting smile, 
! And drop thy pointing finger bright 
As the first flash of beacon light ; 
i Eut neither veil thy head in shadows dim, 
 Nor turn thy face away 
From One who, in the evening of his day, 
To thee would offer no presumptuous hymn ! 
i. 
Bold Spirit ! who art free to rove 
Among the starry courts of Jove, 
And oft in splendour dost appear 
Embodied to poetic eyes, 
While traversing this nether sphere, 
Where Mortals call thee Enterprise. 

Daughter of Hope ! her favourite Child, 
Whom she to young Ambition bore, 
When hunter's arrow first defiled 
The grove, and stained the turf with gore ; 
Thee winged Fancy took, and nursed 
On broad Euphrates' palmy shore, 
And where the mightier Waters burst 
From caves of Indian mountains hoar ! 
She wrapped thee in a panther's skin ; 
And Thou, thy favourite food to win, 
The flame-eyed eagle oft wouldst scare 
From her rock-fortress in mid air, 
With infant shout ; and often sweep, 
Paired with the ostrich, o'er the plain ; 
Or, tired with sport, wouldst sink asleep 
Upon the couchant lion's mane ! 
With rolling years thy strength increased ; 
And, far beyond thy native East, 
To thee, by varying titles known 
As variously thy power was shown, 
Did incense-bearing altars rise, 
Which caught the blaze of sacrifice, 
From suppliants panting for the skies ! 

What though this ancient Earth be trod 
No more by step of Demi-god 
Mounting from glorious deed to deed 
As thou from clime to clime didst lead ; 
Yet still, the bosom beating high, 
And the hushed farewell of an eye 
Where no procrastinating gaze 
A last infirmity betrays, 
Prove that thy heaven-descended sway 
Shall ne'er submit to cold decay. 
By thy divinity impelled, 
The Stripling seeks the tented field ; 
The aspiring Virgin kneels ; and, pale 
With awe, receives the hallowed veil, 
A soft and tender Heroine 
Vowed to severer discipline ; 
Inflamed by thee, the blooming Boy 
Makes of the whistling shrouds a toy, 
And of the ocean's dismal breast 
A play-ground, — or a couch of rest ; 
'Mid the blank world of snow and ice, 
Thou to his dangers dost enchain 
The Chamois-chaser awed in vain 
By chasm or dizzy precipice ; 
And hast Thou not with triumph seen 
How soaring Mortals glide between 
Or through the clouds, and brave the light 
With bolder than Icarian flight ? 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

How they, in bells of crystal, dive — 
Where winds and waters cease to strive — 
For no unholy visitings, 
Among the monsters of the Deep ; 
And all the sad and precious things 
Which there in ghastly silence sleep  
Or, adverse tides and currents headed, 
And breathless calms no longer dreaded, 
In never-slackening voyage go 
Straight as an arrow from the bow ; 
And, slighting sails and scorning oars, 
Keep faith with Time on distant shores ? 
— Within our fearless reach are placed 
The secrets of the burning Waste ; 
Egyptian tombs unlock their dead, 
Nile trembles at his fountain head ; 
Thou speak'st — and lo ! the polar Seas 
Unbosom their last mysteries. 
— But oh ! what transports, what sublime reward, 
Won from the world of mind, dost thou prepare 
For philosophic Sage ; or high-souled Bard 
Who, for thy service trained in lonely woods, 
Hath fed on pageants floating through the air, 
Or calentured in depth of limpid floods ; 
Nor grieves — tho' doomed thro' silent night to bear 
The domination of his glorious themes, 
Or struggle in the net-work of thy dreams ! 

If there be movements in the Patriot's soul, 
From source still deeper, and of higher worth, 
'Tis thine the quickening impulse to control, 
And in due season send the mandate forth ; 
Thy call a prostrate Nation can restore, 
When but a single Mind resolves to crouch no 
more. 

Dread Minister of wrath ! 
Who to their destined punishment dost urge 
The Pharaohs of the earth, the men of hardened 
heart ! 
Not unassisted by the flattering stars, 
Thou strew'st temptation o'er the path 
When they in pomp depart 
With trampling horses and refulgent cars — 
Soon to be swallowed by the briny surge ; 
Or cast, for lingering death, on unknown strands ; 
Or caught amid a whhd of desert sands — 
An Army now, and now a living hill 
That a brief while heaves with convulsive throes — 
Then all is still ; 
Or, to forget their madness and their woes, 
Wrapt in a winding-sheet of spotless snows ! 

Back flows the willing current of my Song : 
If to provoke such doom the Impious dare, 
Why should it daunt a blameless prayer ? 
— Bold Goddess ! range our Youth among ; 
Nor let thy genuine impulse fail to beat 
In hearts no longer young ; 
Still may a veteran Few have pride 
In thoughts whose sternness makes them sweet ; 
In fixed resolves by Reason justified ; 
That to their object cleave like sleet 
Whitening a pine tree's northern side, 
When fields are naked far and wide, 
And withered leaves, from earth's cold breast 
Up-caught in whirlwinds, nowhere can find rest. 

But, if such homage thou disdain 
As doth with mellowing years agree, 
One rarely absent from thy train 
More humble favours may obtain 
For thy contented Votary. 
She, who incites the frolic lambs 
In presence of their heedless dams, 
And to the solitary fawn 
Vouchsafes her lessons, bounteous Nymph 
That wakes the breeze, the sparkling lymph 
Doth hurry to the lawn ; 
She, who inspires that strain of joyance holy 
Which the sweet Bird, misnamed the melancholy 
Pours forth in shady groves, shall plead for rae ; 
And vernal mornings opening bright 
With views of undefined delight, 
And cheerful songs, and suns that shine 
On busy days, with thankful nights, be mine. 

But thou, Goddess ! in thy favourite Isle 
(Freedom's impregnable redoubt, 
The wide earth's store-house fenced about 
With breakers roaring to the gales 
That stretch a thousand thousand sails) 
Quicken the slothful, and exalt the vile ! — 
Thy impulse is the life of Fame ; 
Glad Hope would almost cease to be 
If torn from thy society ; 
And Love, when worthiest of his name, 
Is proud to walk the earth with Thee  

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

 

TO- 

ON HEB FIEST ASCENT TO THS SUMMIT OF HELVELLTN. 
Inmate of a mountain-dwelling, 
Thou hast clomb aloft, and gazed 
From the watch-towers of Heivellyn ; 
Awed, delighted, and amazed ! 
Potent was the spell that hound thee 
Not unwilling to obey ; 
For blue Ether's arms, flung round thee, 
Stilled the pantings of dismay. 
Lo ! the dwindled woods and meadows ; 
What a vast abyss is there ! 
Lo ! the clouds, the solemn shadows, 
And the glistenings — heavenly fair ! 
And a record of commotion 
Which a thousand ridges yield ; 
Ridge, and gulf, and distant ocean 
Gleaming like a silver shield ! 
Maiden ! now take flight ; — inherit 
Alps or Andes — they are thine ! 
With the morning's roseate Spirit, 
Sweep their length of snowy line ; 
Or survey their bright dominions 
In the gorgeous colours drest 
Flung from off the purple pinions, 
Evening spreads throughout the west ! 
Thine are all the coral fountains 
Warbling in each sparry vault 
Of the untrodden lunar mountains ; 
Listen to their songs ! — or halt, 
To Niphates' top invited, 
W hither spiteful Satan steered ; 
Or descend where the ark alighted, 
When the green earth re-appeared ; 
For the power of hills is on thee, 
As was witnessed through thine eye 
Then, when old Heivellyn won thee 
To confess their majesty ! 

TO A YOUNG LADY, 
WHO HAD BEEN REPROACHED FOK TAKING LONG WALKS 
IN THE CODNTRT. 
Dear Child of Nature, let them rail ! 
 — There is a nest in a green dale, 
A harbour and a hold ; 
Where thou, a Wife and Friend, shalt see 
Thy own heart-stirring days, and be 
A light to young and old. 
There, healthy as a shepherd boy, 
And treading among flowers of joy 
Which at no season fade, 
Thou, while thy babes around thee cling, 
Shalt show us how divine a tiling 
A Woman may be made. 
Thy thoughts and feelings shall not die, 
Nor leave thee, when grey hairs are nigh 
A melancholy slave ; 
But an old age serene and bright, 
And lovely as a Lapland night, 
Shall lead thee to thy grave. 

WATER-FOWL. 

' Let me be allowed the aid of verse to describe the evolu- 
' tions which these visitants sometimes perform, on a fine 
' day towards the close of winter.' — Extract from, the 
Author's Book on the Lakes. 
Mark how the feathered tenants of the flood, 
With grace of motion that might scarcely seem 
Inferior to angelical, prolong 
Their curious pastime ! shaping in mid air 
(And sometimes with ambitious wing that soars 
High as the level of the mountain-tops) 
A circuit ampler than the lake beneath — 
Their own domain ; but ever, while intent 
On tracing and retracing that large round, 
Their jubilant activity evolves 
Hundreds of curves and circlets, to and fro, 
Upward and downward, progress intricate 
Yet unperplexed, as if one spirit swayed 
Their indefatigable flight. 'Tis done — 
Ten times, or more, I fancied it had ceased ; 
But lo ! the vanished company again 
Ascending ; they approach — I hear their wings, 
Faint, faint at first ; and then an eager sound, 
Past in a moment— and as faint again ! 
They tempt the sun to sport amid their plumes ; 

 


POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

They tempt the water, or the gleaming ice, 
To show them a fair image ; 'tis themselves, 
Their own fair forms, upon the glimmering plain, 
Painted more soft and fair as they descend 
Almost to touch ; — then up again aloft, 
Up with a sally and a flash of speed, 
As if they scorned both resting-place and rest ! 
. 

VIEW FROM THE TOP OF BLACK COMB. 
This Height a ministering Angel might select : 
For from the summit of Black Comb (dread name 
Derived from clouds and storms ! ) the amplest range 
Of unobstructed prospect may be seen 
That British ground commands : — low dusky tracts, 
Where Trent is nursed, far southward ! Cambrian 
hills 
To the south-west, a multitudinous show ; 
And, in a line of eye-sight linked with these, 
The hoary peaks of Scotland that give birth 
To Tiviot's stream, to Annan, Tweed, and Clyde : — 
Crowding the quarter whence the sun comes forth 
Gigantic mountains rough with crags ; beneath, 
Right at the imperial station's western base 
Main ocean, breaking audibly, and stretched 
Far into silent regions blue and pale ; — 
And visibly engirding Mona's Isle 
That, as we left the plain, before our sight 
Stood like a lofty mount, uplifting slowly 
(Above the convex of the watery globe) 
Into clear view the cultured fields that streak 
Her habitable shores, but now appears 
A dwindled object, and submits to he 
At the spectator's feet. — Yon azure ridge, 
Is it a perishable cloud ? Or there 
Do we behold the line of Erin's coast? 
Land sometimes by the roving shepherd-swain 
(Like the bright confines of another world) 
Not doubtfully perceived. — Look homeward now ! 
In depth, in height, in circuit, how serene 
The spectacle, how pure !— Of Nature's works, 
In earth, and air, and earth-embracing sea, 
A revelation infinite it seems ; 
Display august of man's inheritance, 
Of Britain's calm felicity and power ! 
. 
Black Comb stands at the southern extremity of 
Cumberland : its base covers a much greater extent of 
ground than any other mountain in those parts ; and, 
from its situation, the summit commands a more extensive 
view than any other point in Britain. 

THE HAUNTED TREE. 

Those silver clouds collected round the sun 
His mid-day warmth abate not, seeming less 
To overshade than multiply his beams 
By soft reflection — grateful to the sky, 
To rocks, fields, woods. Nor doth our human 
sense 
Ask, for its pleasure, screen or canopy 
More ample than the time-dismantled Oak 
Spreads o'er this tuft of heath, which now, attired 
In the whole fulness of its bloom, affords 
Couch beautiful as e 'er for earthly use 
Was fashioned ; whether by the hand of Art, 
That eastern Sultan, amid flowers enwrought 
On silken tissue, might diffuse his limbs 
In languor ; or, by Nature, for repose 
Of panting Wood-nymph, wearied with the chase. 
Lady ! fairer in thy Poet's sight 
Than fairest spiritual creature of the groves, 
Approach ; — and, thus invited, crown with rest 
The noon-tide hour : though truly some there are 
Whose footsteps superstitiously avoid 
This venerable Tree ; for, when the wind 
Blows keenly, it sends forth a creaking sound 
(Above the general roar of woods and crags) 
Distinctly heard from far — a doleful note ! 
As if (so Grecian shepherds would have deemed) 
The Hamadryad, pent within, bewailed 
Some bitter wrong. Nor is it unbelieved, 
By ruder fancy, that a troubled ghost 
Haunts the old trunk ; lamenting deeds of which 
The flowery ground is conscious. But no wind 
Sweeps now along this elevated ridge ; 
Not even a zephyr stirs ; — the obnoxious Tree 
Is mute ; and, in his silence, would look down, 
O lovely Wanderer of the trackless hills, 
On thy reclining form with more delight 
Than his coevals in the sheltered vale 
Seem to participate, the while they view 
Their own far-stretching arms and leafy heads 
Vividly pictured in some glassy pool, 
That, for a brief space, checks the hurrying 
stream ! 

THE TRIAD. 

 

THE TEIAD. 
Show me the noblest Youth of present time, 
Whose trembling fancy would to love give birth ; 
Some God or Hero, from the Olympian clime 
Returned, to seek a Consort upon earth ; 
Or, in no doubtful prospect, let me see 
The brightest star of ages yet to be, 
And I will mate and match him blissfully. 
I will not fetch a Naiad from a flood 
Pure as herself — (song lacks not mightier power) 
Nor leaf-crowned Dryad from a pathless wood, 
Nor Sea-nymph glistening from her coral bower ; 
Mere Mortals bodied forth in vision still, 
Shall with Mount Ida's triple lustre fill 
The chaster coverts of a British hill. 
" Appear ! — obey my lyre's command ! 
Come, like the Graces, hand in hand ! 
For ye, though not by birth allied, 
\ Are Sisters in the bond of love ; 
Nor shall the tongue of envious pride 
! Presume those interweavings to reprove 
! In you, which that fair progeny of Jove, 
Learned from the tuneful spheres that glide 
'. In endless union, earth and sea above." 
 — I sing in vain ; — the pines have hushed their 
waving: 
' A peerless Youth expectant at my side, 
! Breathless as they, with unabated craving 
Looks to the earth, and to the vacant air ; 
; And, with a wandering eye that seems to chide, 
Asks of the clouds what occupants they hide : — 
But why solicit more than sight could bear, 
; By casting on a moment all we dare ? 
Invoke we those bright Beings one by one ; 
I And what was boldly promised, truly shall be done. 
" Fear not a constraining measure ! 
—Yielding to this gentle spell, 
Lucida ! from domes of pleasure. 
Or from cottage-sprinkled dell, 
I Come to regions solitary, 
 Where the eagle builds her aery, 
; Above the hermit's long-forsaken cell ! " 
f —She comes ! — behold 
: That Figure, like a ship with snow-white sail ! 
Nearer she draws ; a breeze uplifts her veil ; 
Upon her coming wait 
As pure a sunshine and as soft a gale 

As e'er, on herbage covering earthly mold, 
Tempted the bird of Juno to unfold 
His richest splendour — when his veering gait 
And every motion of his starry train 
Seem governed by a strain 
Of music, audible to him alone. 
" Lady, worthy of earth's proudest throne ! 
Nor less, by excellence of nature, fit 
Beside an unambitious hearth to sit 
Domestic queen, where grandeur is unknown ; 
What living man could fear 
The worst of Fortune's malice, wert Thou near, 
Humbling that lily-stem, thy sceptre meek, 
That its fair flowers may from his cheek 
Brush the too happy tear? 
Queen, and handmaid lowly ! 
Whose skill can speed the day with lively cares, 
And banish melancholy 
By all that mind invents or hand prepares ; 
Thou, against whose lip, without its smile 
And in its silence even, no heart is proof ; 
Whose goodness, sinking deep, would reconcile 
The softest Nursling of a gorgeous palace 
To the bare life beneath the hawthorn-roof 
Of Sherwood's Archer, or in caves of Wallace — - 
Who that hath seen thy beauty could content 
His soul with but a glimpse of heavenly day ? 
Who that hath loved thee, but would lay 
His strong hand on the wind, if it were bent 
To take thee in thy majesty away I 
— Pass onward (even the glancing deer 
Till we depart intrude not here ;) 
That mossy slope, o'er which the woodbine throws 
A canopy, is smoothed for thy repose ! " 
Glad moment is it when the throng 
Of warblers in full concert strong 
Strive, and not vainly strive, to rout 
The lagging shower, and force coy Phoebus out, 
Met by the rainbow's form divine, 
Issuing from her cloudy shrine ; — 
So may the thrillings of the lyre 
Prevail to further our desire, 
While to these shades a sister Nymph I call. 
" Come, if the notes thine ear may pierce, 
Come, youngest of the lovely Three, 
Submissive to the might of verse 
And the dear voice of harmony, 
By none more deeply felt than Thee ! " 
— I sang ; and lo ! from pastimes virginal 
She hastens to the tents 
Of nature, and the lonely elements. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

Air sparkles round her with a dazzling sheen ; 
But mark her glowing cheek, her vesture green ! 
And, as if wishful to disarm 
Or to repay the potent Charm, 
She hears the stringed lute of old romance, 
That cheered the trellised arbour's privacy, 
And soothed war-wearied knights in raftered hall. 
How vivid, yet how delicate, her glee ! 
So tripped the Muse, inventress of the dance ; 
So, truant in waste woods, the blithe Euphrosyne ! 
But the ringlets of that head 
Why are they ungarlanded ? 
Why bedeck her temples less 
Than the simplest shepherdess ? 
Is it not a brow inviting 
Choicest flowers that ever breathed, 
Which the myrtle would delight in 
With Idalian rose enwreathed \ 
But her humility is well content 
With one wild floweret (call it not forlorn) 
Flower of the winds, beneath her bosom worn — 
Yet more for love than ornament. 
Open, ye thickets ! let her fly, 
Swift as a Thracian Nymph o'er field and height ! 
For She, to all but those who love her, shy, 
Would gladly vanish from a Stranger's sight ; 
Though where she is beloved and loves, 
Light as the wheeling butterfly she moves ; 
Her happy spirit as a bird is free, 
That rifles blossoms on a tree, 
Turning them inside out with arch audacity. 
Alas ! how little can a moment show 
Of an eye where feeling plays 
In ten thousand dewy rays ; 
A face o'er which a thousand shadows go ! 
— She stops — is fastened to that rivulet's side ; 
And there (while, with sedater mien, 
O'er timid waters that have scarcely left 
Their birth-place in the rocky cleft 
She bends) at leisure may be seen 
Features to old ideal grace allied, 
Amid their smiles and dimples dignified — 
Fit countenance for the soul of primal truth ; 
The bland composure of eternal youth ! 
What more changeful than the sea ? 
But over his great tides 
Fidelity presides ; 
And this light-hearted Maiden constant is as he. 
High is her aim as heaven above, 
And wide as ether her good-will ; 
And, like the lowly reed, her love 
Can drink its nurture from the scantiest rill : 

Insight as keen as frosty star 
Is to her charity no bar, 
Nor interrupts her frolic graces 
When she is, far from these wild places, 
Encircled by familiar faces. 
the charm that manners draw, 
Nature, from thy genuine law ! 
If from what her hand would do, 
Her voice would utter, aught ensue 
Untoward or unfit ; 
She, in benign affections pure, 
In self-forgetfulness secure, 
Sheds round the transient harm or vague mis- 
chance 
A fight unknown to tutored elegance : 
Her's is not a cheek shame-stricken, 
But her blushes are joy-flushes ; 
And the fault (if fault it be) 
Only ministers to quicken 
Laughter-loving gaiety, 
And kindle sportive wit — 
Leaving this Daughter of the mountains free 
As if she knew that Oberon king of Faery 
Had crossed her purpose with some quaint vagary, 
And heard his viewless bands 
Over their mirthful triumph clapping hands. 



" Last of the Three, though eldest born, 
Reveal thyself, like pensive Morn 
Touched by the skylark's earliest note, 
Ere humbler gladness be afloat. 
But whether in the semblance drest 
Of Dawn — or Eve, fair vision of the west, 
Come with each anxious hope subdued 
By woman's gentle fortitude, 
Each grief, through meekness, settling into rest. 
— Or I would hail thee when some high-wrought 
page 
Of a closed volume lingering in thy hand 
Has raised thy spirit to a peaceful stand 
Among the glories of a happier age." 
Her brow hath opened on me — see it there, 
Brightening the umbrage of her hair ; 
So gleams the crescent moon, that loves 
To be descried through shady groves. 
Tenderest bloom is on her cheek ; 
Wish not for a richer streak ; 
Nor dread the depth of meditative eye j 
But let thy love, upon that azure field 
Of thoughtfulness and beauty, yield 
Its homage offered up in purity. 
What would'st thou more ? In sunny glade, 
Or under leaves of thickest shade, 

THE WISHING-GATE. 

 

Was such a stillness e'er diffused 
; Since earth grew calm while angels mused ? 
' Softly she treads, as if her foot were loth 
To crush the mountain dew-drops — soon to melt 
I On the flower's breast ; as if she felt 
That flowers themselves, whate'er their hue, 
With all their fragrance, all their glistening, 
Call to the heart for inward listening — 
And though for bridal wreaths and tokens true 
Welcomed wisely ; though a growth 
'Which the careless shepherd sleeps on, 
As fitly spring from turf the mourner weeps on — 
And without wrong are cropped the marble tomb 
to strew. 
The Charm is over ; the mute Phantoms gone, 
Nor will return— but droop not, favoured Youth ; 
The apparition that before thee shone 
.Obeyed a summons covetous of truth. 
From these wild rocks thy footsteps I will guide 
To bowers in which thy fortune may be tried, 
And one of the bright Three become thy happy 
Bride. 
. 



XLI. 
THE WISHING-GATE, 

In the vale of Grasmere, by the side of the old high-way lead- 
! ing to Ambleside, is a gate, which, time out of mind, 
has been called the Wishing-gate, from a belief that 
. wishes formed or indulged there have a favourable 
, issue. 
Hope rules a land for ever green : 
All powers that serve the bright-eyed Queen 
Are confident and gay ; 
Clouds at her bidding disappear ; 
Points she to aught  — the bliss draws near, 
And Fancy smooths the way. 
Not such the land of Wishes— there 
Dwell fruitless day-dreams, lawless prayer, 
And thoughts with things at strife ; 
Yet how forlorn, should ye depart 
Ye superstitions of the heart, 
How poor, were human life ! 
When magic lore abjured its might, 
Ye did not forfeit one dear right, 
One tender claim abate ; 
Witness this symbol of your sway, 
Surviving near the public way, 
The rustic Wishing-gate ! 

Inquire not if the faery race 
Shed kindly influence on the place, 
Ere northward they retired ; 
If here a warrior left a spell, 
Panting for glory as he fell ; 
Or here a saint expired. 
Enough that all around is fair, 
Composed with Nature's finest care, 
And in her fondest love — 
Peace to embosom and content — 
To overawe the turbulent, 
The selfish to reprove. 
Yea ! even the Stranger from afar, 
Reclining on this moss-grown bar, 
Unknowing, and unknown, 
The infection of the ground partakes, 
Longing for his Belov'd — who makes 
All happiness her own. 
Then why should conscious Spirits fear 
The mystic stirrings that are here, 
The ancient faith disclaim ? 
The local Genius ne'er befriends 
Desires whose course in folly ends, 
Whose just reward is shame. 
Smile if thou wilt, but not hi scorn, 
If some, by ceaseless pains outworn, 
Here crave an easier lot ; 
If some have thirsted to renew 
A broken vow, or bind a true, 
With firmer, holier knot. 
And not in vain, when thoughts are cast 
Upon the irrevocable past, 
Some Penitent sincere 
May for a worthier future sigh, 
While trickles from his downcast eye 
No unavailing tear. 
The Worldling, pining to be freed 
From turmoil, who would turn or speed 
The current of his fate, 
Might stop before this favoured scene, 
At Nature's call, nor blush to lean 
Upon the Wishing-gate. 
The Sage, who feels how blind, how weak 
Is man, though loth such help to seek, 
Yet, passing, here might pause, 
And thirst for insight to allay 
Misgiving, while the crimson day 
In quietness withdraws ; 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

Or when the church-clock's knell profound 
To Time's first step across the bound 
Of midnight makes reply ; 
Time pressing on with starry crest, 
To filial sleep upon the breast 
Of dread eternity. 

XLII. 
THE WISHING-GATE DESTROYED. 
'Tis gone — with old belief and dream 
That round it clung, and tempting scheme 
Released from fear and doubt ; 
And the bright landscape too must lie, 
By this blank wall, from every eye, 
Relentlessly shut out. 
Bear witness ye who seldom passed 
That opening — but a look ye cast 
Upon the lake below, 
What spirit-stirring power it gained 
From faith which here was entertained, 
Though reason might say no. 
Blest is that ground, where, o'er the springs 
Of history, Glory claps her wings, 
Fame sheds the exulting tear ; 
Yet earth is wide, and many a nook 
Unheard of is, like this, a book 
For modest meanings dear. 
It was in sooth a happy thought 
That grafted, on so fair a spot, 
So confident a token 
Of coming good ; — the charm is fled ; 
Indulgent centuries spun a thread, 
Which one harsh day has broken. 
Alas ! for him who gave the word : 
Could he no sympathy afford, 
Derived from earth or heaven, 
To hearts so oft by hope betrayed ; 
Their very wishes wanted aid 
Which here was freely given ? 
Where, for the love-lorn maiden's wound, 
Will now so readily be found 
A balm of expectation  
Anxious for far-off children, where 
Shall mothers breathe a like sweet air 
Of home-felt consolation  


And not unfelt will prove the loss 
'Mid trivial care and petty cross 
And each day's shallow grief; 
Though the most easily beguiled 
Were oft among the first that smiled 
At their own fond belief. 
If still the reckless change we mourn, 
A reconciling thought may turn 
To harm that might lurk here, 
Ere judgment prompted from within 
Fit aims, with courage to begin, 
And strength to persevere. 
Not Fortune's slave is Man : our state 
Enjoins, while firm resolves await 
On wishes just and wise, 
That strenuous action follow both, 
And life be one perpetual growth 
Of heaven- ward enterprise. 
So taught, so trained, we boldly face 
All accidents of time and place ; 
Whatever props may fail, 
Trust in that sovereign law can spread 
New glory o'er the mountain's head, 
Fresh beauty through the vale. 
That truth informing mind and heart, 
The simplest cottager may part, 
Ungrieved, with charm and spell ; 
And yet, lost Wishing-gate, to thee 
The voice of grateful memory 
Shall bid a kind farewell ! 
See Note at the end of the Volume. 

XLII. 
THE PRIMROSE OF THE ROCK. 
A Rock there is whose homely front 
The passing traveller slights ; 
Yet there the glow-worms hang their lamps, 
Like stars, at various heights ; 
And one coy Primrose to that Rock 
The vernal breeze invites. 
What hideous warfare hath been waged, 
What kingdoms overthrown, 
Since first I spied that Primrose-tuft 
And marked it for my own ; 
A lasting link in Nature's chain 
From highest heaven let down ! 

PRESENTIMENTS. 

 

The flowers, still faithful to the stems, 
Their fellowship renew ; 
The stems are faithful to the root, 
That worketh out of view ; 
And to the rock the root adheres 
In every fihre true. 
Close clings to earth the living rock, 
Though threatening still to fall ; 
The earth is constant to her sphere ; 
And God upholds them all : 
So blooms this lonely Plant, nor dreads 
Her annual funeral. 

Here closed the meditative strain ; 
But air breathed soft that day, 
The hoary mountain-heights were cheered, 
The sunny vale looked gay ; 
And to the Primrose of the Rock 
I gave this after-lay. 
I sang — Let myriads of bright flowers, 
Like Thee, in field and grove 
Revive unenvied ; — mightier far, 
Than tremblings that reprove 
Our vernal tendencies to hope, 
Is God's redeeming love ; 
That love which changed — for wan disease, 
For sorrow that had bent 
O'er hopeless dust, for withered age — 
Their moral element, 
And turned the thistles of a curse 
To types beneficent. 
Sin-blighted though we are, we too, 
The reasoning Sons of Men, 
From one oblivious winter called 
Shall rise, and breathe again ; 
And in eternal summer lose 
Our threescore years and ten. 
To humbleness of heart descends 
This prescience from on high, 
The faith that elevates the just, 
Before and when they die ; 
And makes each soul a separate heaven, 
A court for Deity. 

xuv. 
PRESENTIMENTS. 
Presentiments ! they judge not right 
Who deem that ye from open light 
Retire in fear of shame ; 
All heaven-born Instincts shun the touch 
Of vulgar sense, — and, being such, 
Such privilege ye claim. 
The tear whose source I could not guess, 
The deep sigh that seemed fatherless, 
Were mine in early days ; 
And now, unforced by time to part 
With fancy, I obey my heart, 
And venture on your praise. 
What though some busy foes to good, 
Too potent over nerve and blood, 
Lurk near you — and combine 
To taint the health which ye infuse ; 
This hides not from the moral Muse 
Your origin divine. 
How oft from you, derided Powers ! 
Comes Faith that in auspicious hours 
Builds castles, not of air : 
Bodings unsanctioned by the will 
Flow from your visionary skill, 
And teach us to beware. 
The bosom-weight, your stubborn gift, 
That no philosophy can lift, 
Shall vanish, if ye please, 
Like morning mist : and, where it lay, 
The spirits at your bidding play 
In gaiety and ease. 
Star-guided contemplations move 
Through space, though calm, not raised above 
Prognostics that ye rule; 
The naked Indian of the wild, 
And haply, too, the cradled Child, 
Are pupils of your school. 
But who can fathom your intents, 
Number their signs or instruments ? 
A rainbow, a sunbeam, 
A subtle smell that Spring unbinds, 
Dead pause abrupt of midnight winds, 
An echo, or a dream. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

The laughter of the Christmas hearth 
With sighs of self-exhausted mirth 
Ye feelingly reprove ; 
And daily, in the conscious breast, 
Your visitations are a test 
And exercise of love. 
When some great change gives boundless scope 
To an exulting Nation's hope, 
Oft, startled and made wise 
By your low-breathed interpretings, 
The simply-meek foretaste the springs 
Of bitter contraries. 
Ye daunt the proud array of war, 
Pervade the lonely ocean far 
As sail hath been unfurled; 
For dancers in the festive hall 
What ghastly partners hath your call 
Fetched from the shadowy world. 
'Tis said, that warnings ye dispense, 
Emboldened by a keener sense ; 
That men have lived for whom, 
With dread precision, ye made clear 
The hour that in a distant year 
Should knell them to the tomb. 
Unwelcome insight ! Yet there are 
Blest times when mystery is laid bare, 
Truth shows a glorious face, 
While on that isthmus which commands 
The councils of both worlds, she stands, 
Sage Spirits ! by your grace. 
God, who instructs the brutes to scent 
All changes of the element, 
Whose wisdom fixed the scale 
Of natures, for our wants provides 
By higher, sometimes'humbler, guides, 
When lights of reason fail. 

VERNAL ODE. 

Rerum Niitura tota est nusquam magis quam in minimis. 
Pun. Nat. Hist. 
I, 
Beneath the concave of an April sky, 
When all the fields with freshest green were dight, 
Appeared, in presence of the spiritual eye 
That aids or supersedes our grosser sight, 

The form and rich habiliments of One 
Whose countenance bore resemblance to the sun, 
When it reveals, in evening majesty, 
Features half lost amid their own pure light. 
Poised like a weary cloud, in middle air 
He hung, — then floated with angelic ease 
(Softening that bright effulgence by degrees) 
Till he had reached a summit sharp and bare, 
Where oft the venturous heifer drinks the noon- 
tide breeze. 
Upon the apex of that lofty cone 
Alighted, there the Stranger stood alone ; 
Fair as a gorgeous Fabric of the east 
Suddenly raised by some enchanter's power, 
Where nothing was ; and firm as some old Tower 
Of Britain's realm, whose leafy crest 
Waves high, embellished by a gleaming shower 

ver! i 
ies: li 

Beneath the shadow of his purple wings 
Rested a golden harp ;— he touched the strings 
And, after prelude of unearthly sound 
Poured through the echoing hills around, 
He sang — 
" No wintry desolations, 
Scorching blight or noxious dew, 
Affect my native habitations ; 
Buried in glory, far beyond the scope 
Of man's mquiring gaze, but to his hope 
Imaged, though faintly, in the hue 
Profound of night's ethereal blue ; 
And in the aspect of each radiant orb ; — 
Some fixed, some wandering with no timid curb ; 
But wandering star and fixed, to mortal eye, 
Blended in absolute serenity, 
And free from semblance of decline ; — 
Fresh as if Evening brought their natal hour, 
Her darkness splendour gave, her silence powor, 
To testify of Love and Grace divine. 

What if those bright fires 
Shine subject to decay, 
Sons haply of extinguished sires, 
Themselves to lose their light, or pass away 
Like clouds before the wind, 
Be thanks poured out to Him whose hand bestows 
Nightly, on human land 
That vision of endurance and reposs. 
— And though to every draught of vital breaffl 
Renewed throughout the bounds of earth or oceaiij 
The melancholy gates of Death 
Respond with sympathetic motion ; 

DEVOTIONAL INCITEMENTS. 

 

Though all that feeds on nether air, 
Howe'er magnificent or fair, 
Grows hut to perish, and entrust 
Its ruins to their kindred dust ; 
Yet, by the Almighty's ever-during care, 
Her procreant vigils Nature keeps 
Amid the unfathomable deeps ; 
And saves the peopled fields of earth 
From dread of emptiness or dearth. 
Thus, in their stations, lifting tow'rd the sky 
The foliaged head in cloud-like majesty, 
The shadow-casting race of trees survive : 
Thus, in the train of Spring, arrive 
Sweet flowers ; — what living eye hath viewed 
Their myriads  — endlessly renewed, 
Wherever strikes the sun's glad ray ; 
Where'er the subtle waters stray ; 
Wherever sportive breezes bend 
Their course, or genial showers descend ! 
Mortals, rejoice ! the very Angels quit 
Their mansions unsusceptible of change, 
Amid your pleasant bowers to sit, 
[And through your sweet vicissitudes to range !" 

mO, nursed at happy distance from the cares 
||f a too-anxious world, mild pastoral Muse ! 
That, to the sparkling crown Urania wears, 
I And to her sister Clio's laurel wreath, 
Prefer'st a garland culled from purple heath, 
Or blooming thicket moist with morning dews ; 
Was such bright Spectacle vouchsafed to me \ 
[And was it granted to the simple ear 
Of thy contented Votary 
Such melody to hear ! 
Him rather suits it, side by side with thee, 
Wrapped in a fit of pleasing indolence, 
While thy tired lute hangs on the hawthorn-tree, 
To He and listen — till o'er-drowsed sense 
Sinks, hardly conscious of the influence — 
To the soft murmur of the vagrant Bee. 
—A slender sound ! yet hoary Time 
; Doth to the Soul exalt it with the chime 
Df all his years ; — a company 
Of ages coming, ages gone ; 
Nations from before them sweeping, 
Regions in destruction steeping,) 
But every awful note in unison 
pith that faint utterance, which tells 
Of treasure sucked from buds and bells, 
For the pure keeping of those waxen cells ; 
(Where She — a statist prudent to confer 
ppon the common weal ; a warrior bold, 
Radiant all over with unburnished gold, 

And armed with living spear for mortal fight ; 
A cunning forager 
That spreads no waste ; a social builder ; one 
In whom all busy offices unite 
With all fine functions that afford delight — 
Safe through the winter storm in quiet dwells ! 
v. 
And is She brought within the power 
Of vision ? — o'er this tempting flower 
Hovering until the petals stay 
Her flight, and take its voice away ! — 
Observe each wing ! — a tiny van ! 
The structure of her laden thigh, 
How fragile ! yet of ancestry 
Mysteriously remote and high ; 
High as the imperial front of man ; 
The roseate bloom on woman's cheek ; 
The soaring eagle's curved beak ; 
The white plumes of the floating swan ; 
Old as the tiger's paw, the lion's mane 
Ere shaken by that mood of stern disdain 
At which the desert trembles. — Humming Bee ! 
Thy sting was needless then, perchance unknown, 
The seeds of malice were not sown ; 
All creatures met in peace, from fierceness five, 
And no pride blended with their dignity. 
— Tears had not broken from their source ; 
Nor Anguish strayed from her Tartarean den ; 
The golden years maintained a course 
Not undiversified though smooth and even ; 
We were not mocked with glimpse and shadow then, 
Bright Seraphs mixed familiarly with men ; 
And earth and stars composed a universal heaven ! 
. 

DEVOTIONAL INCITEMENTS. 
' Not to the earth confined, 
Ascend to heaven." 
Where will they stop, those breathing Powers, 
The Spirits of the new-born flowers \ 
They wander with the breeze, they wind 
Where'er the streams a passage find ; 
Up from their native ground they rise 
In mute aerial harmonies ; 
From humble violet — modest thyme — 
Exhaled, the essential odours climb, 
As if no space below the sky 
Their subtle flight could satisfy : 
Heaven will not tax our thoughts with pride 
If like ambition be their guide. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

Roused by this kindliest of May-showers, 
The spirit-quickener of the flowers, 
That with moist virtue softly cleaves 
The buds, and freshens the young leaves, 
The birds pour forth their souls in notes 
Of rapture from a thousand throats — 
Here checked by too impetuous haste, 
While there the music runs to waste, 
With bounty more and more enlarged, 
Till the whole air is overcharged ; 
Give ear, Man ! to their appeal 
And thirst for no inferior zeal, 
Thou, who canst think, as well as feel. 
Mount from the earth ; aspire ! aspire ! 
So pleads the town's cathedral quire, 
In strains that from then." solemn height 
Sink, to attain a loftier flight ; 
While incense from the altar breathes 
Rich fragrance in embodied wreaths ; 
Or, flung from swinging censer, shrouds 
The taper-lights, and curls in clouds 
Around angelic Forms, the still 
Creation of the painter's skill, 
That on the service wait concealed 
One moment, and the next revealed 
- — Cast off your bonds, awake, arise, 
And for no transient ecstasies ! 
What else can mean the visual plea 
Of still or moving imagery — 
The iterated summons loud, 
Not wasted on the attendant crowd, 
Nor wholly lost upon the throng 
Hurrying the busy streets along ? 
Alas ! the sanctities combined 
By art to unsensualise the mind, 
Decay and languish ; or, as creeds 
And humours change, are spurned like weeds : 
The priests are from their altars thrust ; 
Temples are levelled with the dust ; 
And solemn rites and awful forms 
Founder amid fanatic storms. 
Yet evermore, through years renewed 
In undisturbed vicissitude 
Of seasons balancing then' flight 
On the swift wings of day and night, 
Kind Nature keeps a heavenly door 
Wide open for the scattered Poor. 
Where flower-breathed incense to the skies 
Is wafted in mute harmonies ; 
And ground fresh-cloven by the plough 
Is fragrant with a humbler vow ; 

Where birds and brooks from leafy dells 
Chime forth unwearied canticles, 
And vapours magnify and spread 
The glory of the sun's bright head — 
Still constant in her worship, still 
Conforming to the eternal Will, 
Whether men sow or reap the fields, 
Divine monition Nature yields, 
That not by bread alone we live, 
Or what a hand of flesh can give ; 
That every day should leave some part 
Free for a sabbath of the heart : 
So shall the seventh be truly blest, 
From morn to eve, with hallowed rest. 

THE CUCKOO-CLOCK. 
Wouldst thou be taught, when sleep has taken 
flight, 
By a sure voice that can most sweetly tell, 
How far-off yet a glimpse of morning light, 
And if to lure the truant back be well, 
Forbear to covet a Repeater's stroke, 
That, answering to thy touch, will sound the hour ; 
Better provide thee with a Cuckoo-clock 
For service hung behind thy chamber-door ; 
And in due time the soft spontaneous shock, 
The double note, as if with living power, 
Will to composure lead — or make thee blithe as! 
bird in bower. 
List, Cuckoo — Cuckoo ! — oft tho' tempests hew!, 
Or nipping frost remind thee trees are bare, 
How cattle pine, and droop the shivering fowl, 
Thy spirits will seem to feed on balmy air : 
I speak with knowledge, — by that Voice beguiled, 
Thou wilt salute old memories as they throng 
Into thy heart ; and fancies, running wild 
Through fresh green fields, and budding gi o es 
among, 
Will make thee happy, happy as a child ; 
Of sunshine wilt thou think, and flowers, and songJ 
And breathe as in a world where nothing can g 
wrong. 
And know — that, even for him who shuns the da) 
And nightly tosses on a bed of pain ; 
Whose joys, from all but memory swept awav, 
Must come unhoped for, if they come again ; 

TO THE CLOUDS. 

 

Know — that, for him whose waking thoughts, severe 
As his distress is sharp, would scorn my theme, 
The mimic notes, striking upon his ear 
In sleep, and intermingling with his dream, 
Could from sad regions send him to a dear 
Delightful land of verdure, shower and gleam, 
'To mock the wandering Voice beside some haunted 
stream. 
bounty without measure ! while the grace 
! f Heaven doth in such wise, from humblest 
springs, 
Pour pleasure forth, and solaces that trace 
A mazy course along familial things, 
Well may our hearts have faith that blessings come, 
streaming from founts above the starry sky, 
With angels when their own untroubled home 
They leave, and speed on nightly embassy 
To visit earthly chambers, — and for whom % 
ifea, both for souls who God's forbearance try, 
And those that seek his help, and for his mercy sigh. 

TO THE CLOUDS. 

Lrmy of Clouds ! ye winged Host in troops 
Ascending from behind the motionless brow 
W that tall rock, as from a hidden world, 
) whither with such eagerness of speed ? 
jVhat seek ye, or what shun ye ? of the gale 
''ompanions, fear ye to be left behind, 
,r racing o'er your blue ethereal field 
'ontend ye with each other? of the sea 
hildren, thus post ye over vale and height 
'o sink upon your mother's lap — and rest ? 
j'r were ye rightlier hailed, when first mine eyes 
ieheld in your impetuous march the likeness 
:'f a wide army pressing on to meet 
t overtake some unknown enemy ? — 
lut your smooth motions suit a peaceful aim ; 
..nd Fancy, not less aptly pleased, compares 
our squadrons to an endless flight of birds 
erial, upon due migration bound 
;o milder climes ; or rather do ye urge 
'i caravan your hasty pilgrimage 
o pause at last on more aspiring heights 
Jhan these, and utter your devotion there 
jf ith thunderous voice ? Or are ye jubilant, 
jnd would ye, tracking your proud lord the Sun, 
e present at his setting ; or the pomp 
f Persian mornings would ye fill, and stand 

Poising your splendours high above the heads 
Of worshippers kneeling to their up-risen God ? 
Whence, whence, ye Clouds ! this eagerness of 
speed ? 
Speak, silent creatures. — They are gone, are fled, 
Buried together in yon gloomy mass 
That loads the middle heaven ; and clear and bright 
And vacant doth the region which they thronged 
Appear ; a calm descent of sky conducting 
Down to the unapproachable abyss, 
Down to that hidden gulf from which they rose 
To vanish — fleet as days and months and years, 
Fleet as the generations of mankind, 
Power, glory, empire, as the world itself, 
The lingering world, when time hath ceased to be. 
But the winds roar, shaking the rooted trees, 
And see ! a bright precursor to a train 
Perchance as numerous, overpeers the rock 
That sullenly refuses to partake 
Of the wild impulse. From a fount of hie 
Invisible, the long procession moves 
Luminous or gloomy, welcome to the vale 
Which they are entering, welcome to mine eye 
That sees them, to my soul that owns in them, 
And in the bosom of the firmament 
O'er which they move, wherein they are contained, 
A type of her capacious self and all 
Her restless progeny. 
A humble walk 
Here is my body doomed to tread, this path, 
A little hoary line and faintly traced, 
Work, shall we call it, of the shepherd's foot 
Or of his flock \ — joint vestige of them both. 
I pace it unrepining, for my thoughts 
Admit no bondage and my words have wings. 
Where is the Orphean lyre, or Druid harp, 
To accompany the verse ? The mountain blast 
Shall be our hand of music ; he shall sweep 
The rocks, and quivering trees, and biUowy lake, 
And search the fibres of the caves, and they 
Shall answer, for our song is of the Clouds 
And the wind loves them ; and the gentle gales — 
Which by their aid re-clothe the naked lawn 
With annual verdure, and revive the woods, 
And moisten the parched lips of thirsty flowers — 
Love them ; and every idle breeze of air 
Bends to the favourite burthen. Moon and stars 
Keep their most solemn vigils when the Clouds 
Watch also, shifting peaceably their place 
Like bands of ministering Spirits, or when they lie, 
As if some Protean art the change had wrought, 
In listless quiet o'er the ethereal deep 
Scattered, a Cyclades of various shapes 
And all degrees of beauty. ye Lightnings !

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

Ye are their perilous offspring ; and the Sun — 
Source inexhaustible of life and joy, 
And type of man's far-darting reason, therefore 
In old time worshipped as the god of verse, 
A blazing intellectual deity — 
Loves his own glory in their looks, and showers 
Upon that unsubstantial brotherhood 
Visions with all but beatific light 
Enriched — too transient were they not renewed 
From age to age, and did not, while we gaze 
In silent rapture, credulous desire 
Nourish the hope that memory lacks not power 
To keep the treasure unimpaired. Vain thought ! 
Yet why repine, created as we are 
For joy and rest, albeit to find them only 
IiOdged in the bosom of eternal things ? 

SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE OF THE BIRD 
OF PARADISE. 
The gentlest Poet, with free thoughts endowed, 
And a true master of the glowing strain, 
Might scan the narrow province with disdain 
That to the Painter's skill is here allowed. 
This, this the Bird of Paradise ! disclaim 
The daring thought, forget the name ; 
This the Sun's Bird, whom Glendoveers might 
own 
As no unworthy Partner in their flight 
Through seas of ether, where the ruffling sway 
Of nether air's rude billows is unknown ; 
Whom Sylphs, if e'er for casual pastime they 
Through India's spicy regions wing their way, 
Might bow to as their Lord. What character, 
sovereign Nature ! I appeal to thee, 
Of all thy feathered progeny 
Is so unearthly, and what shape so fair ? 
So richly decked in variegated down, 
Green, sable, shining yellow, shadowy brown, 
Tints softly with each other blended, 
Hues doubtfully begun and ended; 
Or intershooting, and to sight 
Lost and recovered, as the rays of light 
Glance on the conscious plumes touched here and 
there ? 
Full surely, when with such proud gifts of life 
Began the pencil's strife, 
O'erweening Art was caught as in a snare. 

A sense of seemingly presumptuous wrong 
Gave the first impulse to the Poet's song ; 
But, of his scorn repenting soon, he drew 
A juster judgment from a calmer view; 
And, with a spirit freed from discontent, 
Thankfully took an effort that was meant 
Not with God's bounty, Nature's love, to vie, 
Or made with hope to please that inward eye 
Which ever strives in vain itself to satisfy, 
But to recal the truth by some faint trace 
Of power ethereal and celestial grace, 
That in the living Creature find on earth a place. 

A JEWISH FAMILY. 

(IN A SMALL VALLEY OPPOSITE ST. GOAB, TPON THE RHINE. 
Genius of Raphael ! if thy wings 
Might bear thee to this glen, 
With faithful memory left of things 
To pencil dear and pen, 
Thou would'st forego the neighbouring Rhine, 
And all his majesty — 
A studious forehead to incline 
J er this poor family. 
The Mother — her thou must have seen, 
In spirit, ere she came 
To dwell these rifted rocks between, 
Or found on earth a name ; 
An image, too, of that sweet Boy, 
Thy inspirations give — 
Of playfulness, and love, and joy, 
Predestined here to live. 
Downcast, or shooting glances far, 
How beautiful his eyes, 
That blend the nature of the star 
With that of summer skies ! 
I speak as if of sense beguiled ; 
Uncounted months are gone, 
Yet am I with the Jewish Child, 
That exquisite Saint John. 
I see the dark-brown curls, the brow, 
The smooth transparent skin, 
Refined, as with intent to show 
The holiness within ; 

ON THE POWER OF SOUND. 

 

The grace of parting Infancy 
By blushes yet untamed ; 
Age faithful to the mother's knee, 
Nor of her arms ashamed. 
Two lovely Sisters, still and sweet 
As flowers, stand side by side ; 
Their soul-subduing looks might cheat 
The Christian of his pride : 
Such beauty hath the Eternal poured 
Upon them not forlorn, 
Though of a lineage once abhorred, 
Nor yet redeemed from scorn. 
Mysterious safeguard, that, in spite 
Of poverty and wrong, 
Doth here preserve a living light, 
From' Hebrew fountains sprung ; 
That gives this ragged group to cast 
Around the dell a gleam 
Of Palestine, of glory past, 
And proud Jerusalem !

Whose piercing sweetness can unloose 
The chains of frenzy, or entice a smile 
Into the ambush of despair ; 
Hosannas pealing down the long-drawn aisle, 
And requiems answered by the pulse that beats 
Devoutly, in life's last retreats ! 

The headlong streams and fountains 
Serve Thee, invisible Spirit, with untired powers ; 
Cheering the wakeful tent on Syrian mountains, 
They lull perchance ten thousand thousand flowers. 
That roar, the prowling lion's Here I am, 
How fearful to the desert wide ! 
That bleat, how tender ! of the dam 
Calling a straggler to her side. 
Shout, cuckoo ! — let the vernal soul 
Go with thee to the frozen zone ; 
Toll from thy loftiest perch, lone bell-bird, toll ! 
At the still hour to Mercy dear, 
Mercy from her twilight throne 
Listening to nun's faint throb of holy fear, 
To sailor's prayer breathed from a darkening sea, 
Or widow's cottage-lullaby. 

Ye Voices, and ye Shadows 
And Images of voice — to hound and horn 
From rocky steep and rock-bestudded meadows 
Flung back, and, in the sky's blue caves, reborn — 
On with your pastime ! till the church-tower bells 
A greeting give of measured glee ; 
And milder echoes from their cells 
Repeat the bridal symphony. 
Then, or far earlier, let us rove 
Where mists are breaking up or gone, 
And from aloft look down into a cove 
Besprinkled with a careless quire, 
Happy milk-maids, one by one 
Scattering a ditty each to her desire, 
A liquid concert matchless by nice Art, 
A stream as if from one full heart. 


Blest be the song that brightens 
The blind man's gloom, exalts the veteran's mirth ; 
Unscorned the peasant's whistling breath, that 
lightens 
His duteous toil of furrowing the green earth. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

For the tired slave, Song lifts the languid oar, 
And bids it aptly fall, with chime 
That beautifies the fairest shore, 
And mitigates the harshest clime. 
Yon pilgrims see — in lagging file 
They move ; but soon the appointed way 
A choral Ave Marie shall beguile, 
And to their hope the distant shrine 
Glisten with a livelier ray : 
Nor friendless he, the prisoner of the mine, 
Who from the well-spring of his own clear breast 
Can draw, and sing his griefs to rest. 
v. 
When civic renovation 
Dawns on a kingdom, and for needful haste 
Best eloquence avails not, Inspiration 
Mounts with a tune, that travels like a blast 
Piping through cave and battlemented tower ; 
Then starts the sluggard, pleased to meet 
That voice of Freedom, in its power 
Of promises, shrill, wild, and sweet ! 
Who, from a martial pageant, spreads 
Incitements of a battle-day, 
Thrilling the unweaponed crowd with plumeless 
heads ? — 
Even She whose Lydian airs inspire 
Peaceful striving, gentle play 
Of timid hope and innocent desire 
Shot from the dancing Graces, as they move 
Fanned by the plausive wings of Love. 
VI. 
How oft along thy mazes, 
Regent of sound, have dangerous Passions trod ! 
Thou, through whom the temple rings with praises, 
And blackening clouds in thunder speak of God, 
Betray not by the cozenage of sense 
Thy votaries, wooingly resigned 
To a voluptuous influence 
That taints the purer, better, mind ; 
But lead sick Fancy to a harp 
That hath in noble tasks been tried ; 
And, if the virtuous feel a pang too sharp, 
Soothe it into patience, — stay 
The uplifted arm of Suicide ; 
And let some mood of thine in firm array 
Knit every thought the impending issue needs, 
Ere mar.tyr burns, or patriot bleeds ! 
vir. 
As Conscience, to the centre 
Of being, smites with irresistible pain 
So shall a solemn cadence, if it enter 
The mouldy vaults of the dull idiot's brain, 

Transmute him to a wretch from quiet hurled — 
Convulsed as by a jarring din ; 
And then aghast, as at the world 
Of reason partially let in 
By concords winding with a sway 
Terrible for sense and soul ! 
Or, awed he weeps, struggling to quell dismay. 
Point not these mysteries to an Art 
Lodged above the starry pole ; 
Pure modulations flowing from the heart 
Of divine Love, where Wisdom, Beauty, Truth 
With Order dwell, in endless youth ? 

Oblivion may not cover 
All treasures hoarded by the miser, Time. 
Orphean Insight ! truth's undaunted lover, 
To the first leagues of tutored passion climb, 
When Music deigned within this grosser sphere 
Her subtle essence to enfold, 
And voice and shell drew forth a tear 
Softer than Nature's self could mould. 
Yet strenuous was the infant Age : 
Art, daring because souls could feel, 
Stirred nowhere but an urgent equipage 
Of rapt imagination sped her march 
Through the realms of woe and weal : 
Hell to the lyre bowed low ; the upper arch 
Rejoiced that clamorous spell and magic verse 
Her wan disasters could disperse. 

The Gift to king Amphion 
That walled a city with its melody 
Was for belief no dream :— thy skill, Arion ! 
Could humanise the creatures of the sea, 
Where men were monsters. A last grace he craves, 
Leave for one chant ; — the dulcet sound 
Steals from the deck o'er willing waves, 
And listening dolphins gather round. 
Self-cast, as with a desperate course, 
'Mid that strange audience, he bestrides 
A proud One docile as a managed horse ; 
And singing, while the accordant hand 
Sweeps his harp, the Master rides ; 
So shall he touch at length a friendly strand, 
And he, with his preserver, shine star-bright 
In memory, through silent night. 

The pipe of Pan, to shepherds 
Couched in the shadow of Msenalian pines, 
Was passing sweet ; the eyeballs of the leopards, 
That in high triumph drew the Lord of vines, 

ON THE POWER OF SOUND. 

 

How did they sparkle to the cymbal's clang ! 
While Fauns and Satyrs beat the ground 
I In cadence, — and Silenus swang 
This way and that, with wild-flowers crowned. 
To life, to life give back thine ear : 
Ye who are longing to be rid 
!Of fable, though to truth subservient, hear 
The little sprinkling of cold earth that fell 
Echoed from the coffin-lid ; 
The convict's summons in the steeple's knell ; 
The vain distress-gun,' from a leeward shore, 
'Repeated — heard, and heard no more ! 

For terror, joy, or pity, 
Vast is the compass and the swell of notes : 
From the babe's first cry to voice of regal city, 
Rolling a solemn sea-like bass, that floats 
iFar as the woodlands — with the trill to blend 
Of that shy songstress, whose love-tale 
Might tempt an angel to descend, 
While hovering o'er the moonlight vale. 
|fe wandering Utterances, has earth no scheme, 
jNo scale of moral music — to unite 
Powers that survive but in the faintest dream 
Df memory ?-^JD that ye might stoop to bear 
Chains, such precious chains of sight 
As laboured minstrelsies through ages wear ! 
p for a balance fit the truth to tell 
Df the Unsubstantial, pondered well ! 

By one pervading spirit 
Of tones and numbers all things are controlled, 
Ka sages taught, where faith was found to merit 
. nidation in that mystery old. 
The heavens, whose aspect makes our minds as still 
Vs they themselves appear to be, 
Enumerable voices fill 
tV'ith everlasting harmony ; 
The towering headlands, crowned with mist, 
Their feet among the billows, know 

That Ocean is a mighty harmonist ; 
Thy pinions, universal Air, 
Ever waving to and fro, 
Are delegates of harmony, and bear 
Strains that support the Seasons in their round ; 
Stern Winter loves a dirge-like sound. 

Break forth into thanksgiving, 
Ye banded instruments of wind and chords ; 
Unite, to magnify the Ever-living, 
Your inarticulate notes with the voice of words ! 
Nor hushed be service from the lowing mead, 
Nor mute the forest hum of noon ; 
Thou too be heard, lone eagle ! freed 
From snowy peak and cloud, attune 
Thy hungry barkings to the hymn 
Of joy, that from her utmost walls 
The six-days' Work, by flaming Seraphim 
Transmits to Heaven ! As Deep to Deep 
Shouting through one valley calls, 
All worlds, all natures, mood and measure keep 
For praise and ceaseless gratulation, poured 
Into the ear of God, their Lord ! 

A Voice to Light gave Being ; 
To Time, and Man his earth-born chronicler ; 
A Voice shall finish doubt and dim foreseeing, 
And sweep away life's visionary stir ; 
The trumpet (we, intoxicate with pride, 
Arm at its blast for deadly wars) 
To archangelic lips applied, 
The grave shall open, quench the stars. 
Silence ! are Man's noisy years 
No more than moments of thy life ? 
Is Harmony, blest queen of smiles and tears, 
With her smooth tones and discords just, 
Tempered into rapturous strife, 
Thy destined bond-slave ? No ! though earth be dust 
And vanish, though the heavens dissolve, her stay 
Is in the Word, that shall not pass away. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

PETER BELL. 
A TALE. 
What 'b in a Name  
Brutus will start a Spirit as soon as Cassar ! 

TO ROBERT SOTJTHEY, ESQ., P.L., etc. etc. 
My Dear Frieni,, 
The Tale of Peter Bell, which I now introduce to your notice, and to that of the rVjIie, 
has, in its Manuscript state, nearly survived its minority :— -for it first saw the light in the summer of . During 
this long interval, pains have been taken at different times to make the production less unworthy of a favourable 
reception ; or, rather, to fit it for filling permanently a station, however humble, in the Literature of our Country. 
This has, indeed, been the aim of all my endeavours in Poetry, which, you know, have been sufficiently laborious 
to prove that I deem the Art not lightly to be approached ; and that the attainment of excellence in it, may laudably 
be made the principal object of intellectual pursuit by any man, who, with reasonable consideration of circumstances, 
has faith in his own impulses. 
The Poem of Peter Bell, as the Prologue will show, was composed under a belief that the Imagination not only does 
not require for its exercise the intervention of supernatural agency, but that, though such agency be excluded, the 
faculty may be called forth as imperiously and for kindred results of pleasure, by incidents, within the compass of 
poetic probability, in the humblest departments of daily life. Since that Prologue was written, you have exhibited 
most splendid effects of judicious daring, in the opposite and usual course. Let this acknowledgment make my peace 
with the lovers of the supernatural ; and I am persuaded it will be admitted, that to you, as a Master in that province 
of the art, the fallowing Tale, whether from contrast or congruity, is not an unappropriate offering. Accept it, then, 
as a public testimony of affectionate admiration from one with whose name yours has been often coupled (to use your 
own words) for evil and for good ; and believe me to be, with earnest wishes that life and health may be granted you to 
complete the many important works in which you are engaged, and with high respect, 
Most faithfully yours, WILLIAM WORDSWORTH. 
Rvdal Mount, April , . 

PROLOGUE. 
There 's something in a flying horse, 
There 's something in a huge balloon ; 
But through the clouds  ' never float 
Until I have a little Boat, 
Shaped like the crescent-moon. 
And now I have a little Boat, 
In shape a very crescent-moon : 
Fast through the clouds my boat can sail ; 
But if perchance your faith should fail, 
Look up — and you shall see me soon ! 
The woods, my Friends, are round you roaring, 
Rocking and roaring like a sea ; 
The noise of danger's in your ears, 
And ye have all a thousand fears 
Both for my little Boat and me ! 
Meanwhile untroubled I admire 
The pointed horns of my canoe ; 
And, did not pity touch my breast, 
To see how ye are all distrest, 
Till my ribs ached, I 'd laugh at you ! 

Away we go, my Boat and I — 
Frail man ne'er sate in such another ; 
Whether among the winds we strive, 
Or deep into the clouds we dive, 
Each is contented with the other. 
Away we go — and what care we 
For treasons, tumults, and for wars ? 
We are as calm in our delight 
As is the crescent-moon so bright 
Among the scattered stars. 
Up goes my Boat among the stars 
Through many a breathless field of light, 
Through many a long blue field of ether, 
Leaving ten thousand stars beneath her : 
Up goes my little Boat so bright ! 
The Crab, the Scorpion, and the Bull — 
We pry among them all ; have shot 
High o'er the red-haired race of Mars, 
Covered from top to toe with scars ; 
Such company I like it not ! 

PETER BELL. 

 

The towns in Saturn are decayed, 
And melancholy Spectres throng them ; — 
The Pleiads, that appear to kiss 
Each other in the vast abyss, 
With ioy I sail among them. 
Swift Mercury resounds with mirth, 
Great Jove is full of stately bowers ; 
But these, and all that they contain, 
What are they to that tiny grain, 
That little Earth of ours ? 
Then back to Earth, the dear green Earth : — 
Whole ages if I here should roam, 
The world for my remarks and me 
Would not a whit the better be ; 
I 've left my heart at home. 
See ! there she is, the matchless Earth ! 
There spreads the famed Pacific Ocean ! 
Old Andes thrusts yon craggy spear 
Through the grey clouds ; the Alps are here, 
Like waters in commotion ! 
Yon tawny slip is Libya's sands ; 
That silver thread the river Dnieper ; 
And look, where clothed in brightest green 
Is a sweet Isle, of isles the Queen ; 
Ye fairies, from all evil keep her ! 
And see the town where I was born ! 
Around those happy fields we span 
In boyish gambols ; — I was lost 
Where I have been, but on this coast 
I feel I am a man. 
Never did fifty things at once 
Appear so lovely, never, never ; — 
How tunefully the forests ring ! 
To hear the earth's soft murmuring 
Thus could I hang for ever ! 
" Shame on you ! " cried my little Boat, 
" Was ever such a homesick Loon, 
Within a living Boat to sit, 
| And make no better use of it ; 
A Boat twin-sister of the crescent-moon ! 
Ne'er in the breast, of full-grown Poet 
Fluttered so faint a heart before ;— 
Was it the music of the spheres 
That overpowered your mortal ears  
— Such din shall trouble them no more. 

These nether precincts do not lack 
Charms of their own ; — then come with me ; 
I want a comrade, and for you 
There 's nothing that I would not do ; 
Nought is there that you shall not see. 
Haste ! and above Siberian snows 
We ' sport amid the boreal morning ; 
Will mingle with her lustres gliding 
Among the stars, the stars now hiding, 
And now the stars adorning. 
I know the secrets of a land 
Where human foot did never stray ; 
Fair is that land as evening skies, 
And cool, though in the depth it lies 
Of burning Africa. 
Or we ' into the realm of Faery, 
Among the lovely shades of things ; 
The shadowy forms of mountains bare, 
And streams, and bowers, and ladies fair, 
The shades of palaces and kings ! 
Or, if you thirst with hardy zeal 
Less quiet regions to explore, 
Prompt voyage shall to you reveal 
How earth and heaven are taught to feel 
The might of magic lore ! " 
"My little vagrant Form of light, 
My gay and beautiful Canoe, 
Well have you played your friendly part ; 
As kindly take what from my heart 
Experience forces — then adieu ! 
Temptation lurks among your words ; 
But, while these pleasures you 're pursuing 
Without impediment or let, 
No wonder if you quite forget 
What on the earth is doing. 
There was a time when all mankind 
Did listen with a faith sincere 
To tuneful tongues in mystery versed ; 
Then Poets fearlessly rehearsed 
The wonders of a wild career. 
Go — (but the world 's a sleepy world, 
And 'tis, I fear, an age too late) 
Take with you some ambitious Youth ! 
For, restless Wanderer ! I, in truth, 
Am all unfit to be your mate. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

Long have I loved what I behold, 
The night that calms, the day that cheers ; 
The common growth of mother-earth 
Suffices me — her tears, her mirth, 
Her humblest mirth and tears. 
The dragon's wing, the magic ring, 
I shall not covet for my dower, 
If I along that lowly way 
With sympathetic heart may stray, 
And with a soul of power. 
These given, what more need I desire 
To stir, to soothe, or elevate ? 
What nobler marvels than the mind 
May in life's daily prospect find, 
May find or there create ? 
A potent wand doth Sorrow wield ; 
What spell so strong as guilty Fear ! 
Repentance is a tender Sprite ; 
If aught on earth have heavenly might, 
'Tis lodged within her silent tear. 
But grant my wishes, — let us now 
Descend from this ethereal height ; 
Then take thy way, adventurous Skiff, 
More daring far than Hippogriff, 
And be thy own delight ! 
To the stone-table in my garden, 
Loved haunt of many a summer hour, 
The Squire is come : his daughter Bess 
Beside him in the cool recess 
Sits blooming like a flower. 
With these are many more convened ; 
They know not I have been so far ; — 
I see them there, in number nine, 
Beneath the spreading Weymouth-pine ! 
I see them — there they are ! 
There sits the Vicar and his Dame ; 
And there my good friend, Stephen Otter ; 
And, ere the light of evening fail, 
To them I must relate the Tale 
Of Peter Bell the Potter." 
Off flew the Boat — away she flees, 
Spurning her freight with indignation ! 
And I, as well as I was able, 
On two poor legs, toward my stone-table 
Limped on with sore vexation. 

", here he is !" cried little Bess — 
She saw me at the garden-door ; 
"We 've waited anxiously and long," 
They cried, and all around me throng, 
Full nine of them or more ! 
" Reproach me not — your fears be still — 
Be thankful we again have met ; — 
Resume, my Friends ! within the shade 
Your seats, and quickly shall be paid 
The well-remembered debt." 
I spake with faltering voice, like one 
Not wholly rescued from the pale 
Of a wild dream, or worse illusion ; 
But, straight, to cover my confusion, 
Began the promised Tale. 

PART FIRST. 
All by the moonlight river side 
Groaned the poor Beast — alas ! in vain ; 
The staff was raised to loftier height, 
And the blows fell with heavier weight 
As Peter struck — and struck again. 
"Hold !" cried the Squire, " against the rules 
Of common sense you 're surely sinning ; 
This leap is for us all too bold ; 
Who Peter was, let that be told, 
And start from the beginning." 
"A Potter, Sir, he was by trade," 
Said I, becoming quite collected ; 
"And wheresoever he appeared, 
Full twenty times was Peter feared 
For once that Peter was respected. 
He, two-and-thirty years or more, 
Had been a wild and woodland rover ; 
Had heard the Atlantic surges roar 
On farthest Cornwall's rocky shore, 
And trod the cliffs of Dover. 
And he had seen Caernarvon's towers, 
And well he knew the spire of Sarum ; 
And he had been where Lincoln bell 
Flings o'er the fen that ponderous knell — 
A far-renowned alarum ! 

 In the dialect of the North, a hawker of earthenwar 
is thus designated. 

PETER BELL.  
.. 

At Doncaster, at York, and Leeds, 
i And merry Carlisle had he been ; 
! And all along the Lowlands fair, 
All through the bonny shire of Ayr; 
: And far as Aberdeen. 

At noon, when, by the forest's edge 
He lay beneath the branches high, 
The soft blue sky did never melt 
Into his heart ; he never felt 
The witchery of the soft blue sky ! 

, And he had been at Inverness ; 
And Peter, by the mountain-rills, 
Had danced his round with Highland lasses ; 
, And he had lain beside his asses 
On lofty Cheviot Hills : 

On a fair prospect some have looked 
And felt, as I have heard them say, 
As if the moving time had been 
A thing as steadfast as the scene 
On which they gazed themselves away. 

And he had trudged through Yorkshire dales, 
Among the rocks and winding scars; 
Where deep and low the hamlets lie 
Beneath their little patch of sky 
And little lot of stars : 

Within the breast of Peter Bell 
These silent raptures found no place ; 
He was a Carl as wild and rude 
As ever hue-and-cry pursued, 
As ever ran a felon's race. 

And all along the indented coast, 
Bespattered with the salt-sea foam ; 
\ Where'er a knot of houses lay 
On headland, or in hollow bay ; — 
' Sure never man like him did roam ! 

Of all that lead a lawless life, 
Of all that love their lawless lives, 
In city or in village small, 
He was the wildest far of all ; — 
He had a dozen wedded wives. 

As well might Peter, in the Fleet, 
Have been fast bound, a begging debtor ; — 
! He travelled here, he travelled there ; — 
But not the value of a hair 
Was heart or head the better. 

Nay, start not ! — wedded wives — and twelve ! 
But how one wife could e'er come near him, 
In simple truth I cannot tell ; 
For, be it said of Peter Bell, 
To see him was to fear him. 

He roved among the vales and streams, 
In the green wood and hollow deU ; 
They were his dwellings night and day, — 
But nature ne'er could find the way 
Into the heart of Peter Bell. 

Though Nature could not touch his heart 
By lovely forms, and silent weather, 
And tender sounds, yet you might see 
At once, that Peter Bell and she 
Had often been together. 

In vain, through every changeful year, 
Did Nature lead him as before ; 
A primrose by a river's brim 
A. yellow primrose was to him, 
And it was nothing more. 

A savage wildness round him hung 
As of a dweller out of doors ; 
In his whole figure and his mien 
A savage character was seen 
Of mountains and of dreary moors. 

Small change it made in Peter's heart 
To see his gentle panniered train 
With more than vernal pleasure feeding, 
Where'er the tender grass was leading 
Its earliest green along the lane. 

To all the unshaped half-human thoughts 
Which solitary Nature feeds 
'Mid summer storms or winter's ice, 
Had Peter joined whatever vice 
The cruel city breeds. 

In vain, through water, earth, and air, 
The soul of happy sound was spread, 
When Peter on some April morn, 
Beneath the broom or budding thorn, 
Made the warm earth his lazy bed. 

His face was keen as is the wind 
That cuts along the hawthorn-fence ; 
Of courage you saw little there, 
But, in its stead, a medley air 
Of cunning and of impudence. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

He had a dark and sidelong walk, 
And long and slouching was his gait ; 
Beneath his looks so bare and bold, 
You might perceive, his spirit cold 
Was playing with some inward bait. 
His forehead wrinkled was and furred ; 
A work, one half of which was done 
By thinking of his ' whens' and ' hows ;' 
And half, by knitting of his brows 
Beneath the glaring sun. 
There was a hardness in his cheek, 
There was a hardness in his eye, 
As if the man had fixed his face, 
In many a solitary place, 
Against the wind and open sky ! " 

One night, (and now my little Bess ! 
We 've reached at last the promised Tale ;) 
One beautiful November night, 
When the full moon was shining bright 
Upon the rapid river Swale, 
Along the river's winding banks 
Peter was travelling all alone ; — 
Whether to buy or sell, or led 
By pleasure running in his head, 
To me was never known. 
He trudged along through copse and brake, 
He trudged along o'er hill and dale ; 
Nor for the moon cared he a tittle, 
And for the stars he cared as little, 
And for the murmuring river Swale. 
But, chancing to espy a path 
That promised to cut short the way ; 
As many a wiser man hath done, 
He left a trusty guide for one 
That might his steps betray. 
To a thick wood he soon is brought 
Where cheerily his course he weaves, 
And whistling loud may yet be heard, 
Though often buried, like a bird 
Darkling, among the boughs and leaves. 
But quickly Peter's mood is changed, 
And on he drives with cheeks that burn 
In downright fury and in wrath ; — 
There 's little sign the treacherous path 
Will to the road return ! 

The path grows dim, and dimmer still ; 
Now up, now down, the Rover wends, 
With all the sail that he can carry, 
Till brought to a deserted quarry — 
And there the pathway ends. 
He paused — for shadows of strange shape, 
Massy and black, before him lay ; 
But through the dark, and through the cold, 
And through the yawning fissures old, 
Did Peter boldly press bis way 
Right through the quarry ; — and behold 
A scene of soft and lovely hue ! 
Where blue and grey, and tender green. 
Together make as sweet a scene 
As ever human eye did view. 
Beneath the clear blue sky he saw 
A little field of meadow ground ; 
But field or meadow name it not ; 
Call it of earth a small green plot, 
With rocks encompassed round. 
The Swale flowed under the grey rocks, 
But he flowed quiet and unseen ; — 
You need a strong and stormy gale 
To bring the noises of the Swale 
To that green spot, so calm and green ! 
And is there no one dwelling here, 
No hermit with his beads and glass ? 
And does no little cottage look 
Upon this soft and fertile nook ? 
Does no one five near this green grass ? 
Across the deep and quiet spot 
Is Peter driving through the grass — 
And now has reached the skirting trees ; 
When, turning round his head, he sees 
A solitary Ass. 
" A prize !" cries Peter — but he first 
Must spy about him far and near : 
There 's not a single house in sight, 
No woodman's hut, no cottage light — 
Peter, you need not fear ! 
There 's nothing to be seen but woods, 
And rocks that spread a hoary gleam, 
And this one Beast, that from the bed 
Of the green meadow hangs his head 
Over the silent stream. 

PETER BELL. 

 

His head is with a halter bound; 
The halter seizing, Peter leapt 
Upon the Creature's back, and plied 
With ready heels his shaggy side ; 
But still the Ass Ms station kept. 
Then Peter gave a sudden jerk, 
A jerk that from a dungeon-floor 
Would have pulled up an iron ring ; 
But still the heavy-headed Thing 
Stood just as he had stood before ! 
Quoth Peter, leaping from his seat, 
" There is some plot against me laid ;" 
Once more the little meadow-ground 
And all the hoary cliffs around 
He cautiously surveyed. 
All, all is silent — rocks and woods, 
All still and silent — far and near ! 
Only the Ass, with motion dull, 
Upon the pivot of his skull 
Turns round his long left ear. 
Thought Peter, What can mean all this ? 
Some ugly witchcraft must be here ! 
— Once more the Ass, with motion dull, 
Upon the pivot of his skull 
' Turned round his long left ear. 
Suspicion ripened into dread ; 
 Yet with deliberate action slow, 
His staff high-raising, in the pride 
Of skill, upon the sounding hide, 
i He dealt a sturdy blow. 
The poor Ass staggered with the shock ; 
And then, as if to take his ease, 
 In quiet uncomplaining mood, 
Upon the spot where he had stood, 
Dropped gently down upon his knees ; 
\ As gently on his side he fell ; 
, And by the river's brink did lie ; 
And, while he lay like one that mourned, 
iThe patient Beast on Peter turned 
His shining hazel eye. 
'Twas but one mild, reproachful look, 
A look more tender than severe ; 
And straight in sorrow, not in dread, 
He turned the eye-ball in his head 
Towards the smooth river deep and clear. 

Upon the Beast the sapling rings ; 
His lank sides heaved, his limbs they stirred ; 
He gave a groan, and then another, 
Of that which went before the brother, 
And then he gave a third. 
All by the moonlight river side 
He gave three miserable groans ; 
And not till now hath Peter seen 
How gaunt the Creature is, — how lean 
And sharp his staring bones ! 
With legs stretched out and stiff he lay : — 
No word of land commiseration 
Fell at the sight from Peter's tongue ; 
With hard contempt his heart was wrung, 
With hatred and vexation. 
The meagre beast lay still as death ; 
And Peter's lips with fury quiver ; 
Quoth he, " You little mulish dog, 
I ' fling your carcass like a log 
Head-foremost down the river !" 
An impious oath confirmed the threat — 
Whereat from the earth on which he lay 
To all the echoes, south and north, 
And east and west, the Ass sent forth 
A long and clamorous bray ! 
This outcry, on the heart of Peter, 
Seems like a note of joy to strike, — 
Joy at the heart of Peter knocks ; 
But in the echo of the rocks 
Was something Peter did not like. 
Whether to cheer his coward breast, 
Or that he could not break the chain, 
In this serene and solemn hour, 
Twined round him by demoniac power, 
To the blind work he turned again. 
Among the rocks and winding crags ; 
Among the mountains far away ; 
Once more the Ass did lengthen out 
More ruefully a deep-drawn shout, 
The hard dry see-saw of his horrible bray ! 
What is there now in Peter's heart ! 
Or whence the might of this strange sound I 
The moon uneasy looked and dimmer, 
The broad blue heavens appeared to glimmer, 
And the rocks staggered all around — 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

From Peter's hand the sapling dropped ! 
Threat has he none to execute ; 

PART SECOND. 

" If any one should come and see 

We left our Hero in a trance, 

That I am here, they ' think," quoth he, 

Beneath the alders, near the river ; 

" I 'm helping this poor dying hrute." 

The Ass is by the river-side, 
And, where the feeble breezes glide, 

He scans the Ass from limb to limb, 

Upon the stream the moonbeams quiver. 

And ventures now to uplift his eyes ; 
More steady looks the moon, and clear, 
More like themselves the rocks appear 
And touch more quiet skies. 

A happy respite ! but at length 
He feels the glimmering of the moon ; 
Wakes with glazed eye, and feebly sighing — 
To sink, perhaps, where he is lying, 

His scorn returns — his hate revives ; 

Into a second swoon ! 

He stoops the Ass's neck to seize 
With malice — that again takes flight ; 
For in the pool a startling sight 
Meets him, among the inverted trees. 

He lifts his head, he sees his staff ; 
He touches — 'tis to him a treasure ! 
Faint recollection seems to tell 
That he is yet where mortals dwell — 

Is it the moon's distorted face I 

A thought received with languid pleasure ! 

The ghost-like image of a cloud ? 
Is it a gallows there portrayed ! 
Is Peter of himself afraid ? 
Is it a coffin, — or a shroud \ 

His head upon his elbow propped, 
Becoming less and less perplexed, 
Sky-ward he looks — to rock and wood — 
And then — upon the glassy flood 

A grisly idol hewn in stone ? 

His wandering eye is fixed. 

Or imp from witch's lap let fall ? 

Thought he, that is the face of one 

Perhaps a ring of shining fairies ? 

In his last sleep securely bound ! 

Such as pursue their feared vagaries 
In sylvan bower, or haunted hall ? 
Is it a fiend that to a stake 
Of fire his desperate self is tethering ? 
Or stubborn spirit doomed to yell 
In solitary ward or cell, 
Ten thousand miles from all his brethren ? 
Never did pulse so quickly throb, 
And never heart so loudly panted ; 
He looks, he cannot choose but look ; 
Like some one reading in a book — 
A book that is enchanted. 
Ah, weil-a-day for Peter Bell ! 
He will be turned to iron soon, 
Meet Statue for the court of Fear ! 
His hat is up — and every hair 
Bristles, and whitens in the moon ! 
He looks, he ponders, looks again ; 
He sees a motion — hears a groan ; 
His eyes will burst — his heart will break — 
He gives a loud and frightful shriek, 
And back he falls, as if his life were flown ! 

So toward the stream his head he bent, 
And downward thrust his staff, intent 
The river's depth to sound. 
Now — like a tempest-shattered bark, 
That overwhelmed and prostrate lies, 
And in a moment to the verge 
Is lifted of a foaming surge — 
Full suddenly the Ass doth rise ! 
His staring bones all shake with joy, 
And close by Peter's side he stands : 
While Peter o'er the river bends, 
The little Ass his neck extends, 
And fondly licks his hands. 
Such life is in the Ass's eyes, 
Such life is in his limbs and ears ; 
That Peter Bell, if he had been 
The veriest coward ever seen, 
Must now have thrown aside his fears. 
The Ass looks on — and to his work 
Is Peter quietly resigned ; 
He touches here — he touches there — 
And now among the dead man's hair 
His sapling Peter has entwined. 

PETER BELL. 

 

He pulls — and looks — and pulls again ; 
And he whom the poor Ass had lost, 
The man who had been four days dead, 
Head-foremost from the river's bed 
Uprises like a ghost ! 
 And Peter draws him to dry land ; 
And through the brain of Peter pass 
I Some poignant twitches, fast and faster ; 
;"No doubt," quoth he, "he is the Master 
! Of this poor miserable Ass ! " 
The meagre Shadow that looks on — 
i What would he now  what is he doing ? 
I His sudden fit of joy is flown, — 
i He on his knees hath laid him down, 
! As if he were his grief renewing ; 
But no — that Peter on his back 
Must mount, he shews well as he can : 
' Thought Peter then, come weal or woe, 
I I ' do what he would have me do, 
I In pity to this poor drowned man. 
; With that resolve he boldly mounts 
: Upon the pleased and thankful Ass ; 
And then, without a moment's stay, 
! That earnest Creature turned away, 
Leaving the body on the grass. 
Intent upon his faithful watch, 
The Beast four days and nights had past ; 
A sweeter meadow ne'er was seen, 
And there the Ass four days had been, 
i Nor ever once did break his fast : 
Yet firm his step, and stout his heart ; 
The mead is crossed- — the quarry's mouth 
Is reached ; but there the trusty guide 
Into a thicket turns aside, 
And deftly ambles towards the south. 
J When hark a burst of doleful sound ! 
: And Peter honestly might say, 
:, The like came never to his ears, 
 Though he has been, full thirty years, 
A rover — night and day ! 
I . 
I 'Tis not a plover of the moors, 
I 'Tis not a bittern of the fen; 
! Nor can it be a barking fox, 
j Nor night-bird chambered in the rocks, 
Nor wild-cat in a woody glen! 

The Ass is startled — and stops short 
Right in the middle of the thicket ; 
And Peter, wont to whistle loud 
Whether alone or in a crowd, 
Is silent as a silent cricket. 
What ails you now, my little Bess ? 
Well may you tremble and look grave ! 
This cry — that rings along the wood, 
This cry — that floats adown the flood, 
Comes from the entrance of a cave : 
I see a blooming Wood-boy there, 
And if I had the power to say 
How sorrowful the wanderer is, 
Your heart would be as sad as his 
Till you had kissed his tears away ! 
Grasping a hawthorn branch in hand, 
All bright with berries ripe and red, 
Into the cavern's mouth he peeps ; 
Thence back into the moonlight creeps ; 
Whom seeks he — whom ?— the silent dead : 
His father ! — Him doth he require — 
Him hath he sought with fruitless pains, 
Among the rocks, behind the trees ; 
Now creeping on his hands and knees, 
Now running o'er the open plains. 
And hither is he come at last, 
When he through such a day has gone, 
By this dark cave to be distrest 
Like a poor bird — her plundered nest 
Hovering around with dolorous moan ! 
Of that intense and piercing cry 
The listening Ass conjectures well; 
Wild as it is, he there can read 
Some intermingled notes that plead 
With touches irresistible. 
But Peter — when he saw the Ass 
Not only stop but turn, and change 
The cherished tenor of his pace 
That lamentable cry to chase — 
It wrought in him conviction strange ; 
A faith that, for the dead man's sake 
And this poor slave who loved him well, 
Vengeance upon his head will fall, 
Some visitation worse than all 
Which ever till this night befel.
