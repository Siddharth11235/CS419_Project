THE CONCLUSION OF A POEM, COMPOSED IN ANTI- 
CIPATION OF LEAVING SCHOOL. 
Dear native regions, I foretell, 
From what I feel at this farewell, 
That, wheresoe'er my steps may tend, 
And whensoe'er my course shall end, 
If in that hour a single tie 
Survive of local sympathy, 
My soul will cast the backward view, 
The longing look alone on you. 
Thus, while the Sun sinks down to rest 
Far in the regions of the west, 
Though to the vale no parting beam 
Be given, not one memorial gleam, 
A lingering light he fondly throws 
On the dear hills where first he rose. 
. 

WRITTEN IN VERY EARLY YOUTH 
Calm is all nature as a resting wheel. 
The kine are couched upon the dewy grass ; 
The horse alone, seen dimly as I pass, 
Is cropping audibly his later meal : 
Dark is the ground ; a slumber seems to steal 
O'er vale, and mountain, and the starless sky. 
Now, in this blank of things, a harmony, 
Home-felt, and home-created, comes to heal 
That grief for which the senses still supply 
Fresh food ; for only then, when memory 
Is hushed, am I at rest. My Friends ! restrain 
Those busy cares that would allay my pain ; 
Oh ! leave me to myself, nor let me feel 
The officious touch that makes me droop again.

Far from my dearest Friend, 'tis mine to rove 
Through bare grey dell, high wood, and pastoral cove ; 
Where Derwent rests, and listens to the roar 
That stuns the tremulous cliffs of high Lodore ; 
Where peace to Grasmere's lonely island leads, 
To willowy hedge-rows, and to emerald meads ; 
Leads to her bridge, rude church, and cottaged 
grounds, 
Her rocky sheepwalks, and her woodland bounds ; 
Where, undisturbed by winds, Winander sleeps 
'Mid clustering isles, and holly-sprinkled steeps ; 
Where twilight glens endear my Esthwaite's shore, 
And memory of departed pleasures, more. 
Fair scenes, erewhile, I taught, a happy child, 
The echoes of your rocks my carols wild : 
The spirit sought not then, in cherished sadness, 
A cloudy substitute for failing gladness. 
In youth's keen eye the livelong day was bright, 
The sun at morning, and the stars at night, 
Alike, when first the bittern's hollow bill 
Was heard, or woodcocks roamed the moonlight 
hill. 
In thoughtless gaiety I coursed the plain, 
And hope itself was all I knew of pain ; 
For then, the inexperienced heart would beat 
At times, while young Content forsook her seat, 
And wild Impatience, pointing upward, showed, 
Through passes yet unreached, a brighter road. 
Alas ! the idle tale of man is found 
Depicted in the dial's moral round ; 
Hope with reflection blends her social rays 
To gild the total tablet of his days ; 
Yet still, the sport of some malignant power, 
He knows but from its shade the present hour. 

 These lines are only applicable to the middle part of 
that lake. 
 In the beginning of winter, ttiese mountains are fre- 
quented by woodcocks, which in dark nights retire into 
the woods. 

But why, ungrateful, dwell on idle pain ? 
To show what pleasures yet to me remain, 
Say, will my Friend, with unreluctant ear, 
The history of a poet's evening hear ? 
When, in the south, the wan noon, brooding still, 
Breathed a pale steam around the glaring hill, 
And shades of deep-embattled clouds were seen, 
Spotting the northern cliffs with lights between ; 
When crowding cattle, checked by rails that make 
A fence far stretched into the shallow lake, 
Lashed the cool water with their restless tails, 
Or from high points of rock looked out for fanning 
gales ; 
When school-boys stretched their length upon the 
green ; 
And round the broad-spread oak, a glimmering 
scene, 
In the rough fern-clad park, the herded deer 
Shook the still-twinkling tail and glancing ear ; 
When horses in the sunburnt intake stood, 
And vainly eyed below the tempting flood, 
Or tracked the passenger, in mute distress, 
With forward neck the closing gate to press — 
Then, while I wandered where the huddling rill 
Brightens with water-breaks the hollow ghyll \ 
As by enchantment, an obscure retreat 
Opened at once, and stayed my devious feet. 
While thick above the rill the branches close, 
In rocky basin its wild waves repose, 
Inverted shrubs, and moss of gloomy green, 
Cling from the rocks, with pale wood-weeds be- 
. tween ; 
And its own twilight softens the whole scene, 
Save where aloft the subtle sunbeams shine 
On withered briars that o'er the crags recline ; 
Save where, with sparkling foam, a small cascade 
Illumines, from within, the leafy shade ; 
Beyond, along the vista of the brook, 
Where antique roots its bustling course o'erlook, 
The eye reposes on a secret bridge J 
Half grey, half shagged with ivy to its ridge ; 
There, bending o'er the stream, the listless swain 
Lingers behind his disappearing wain. 
— Did Sabine grace adorn my living line, 
Blandusia's praise, wild stream, should yield to 
thine ! 

 The word intake is local, and signifies a mountain- 
inelosure. 
t Ghyll is also, I believe, a term confined to this coun- 
try : ghyll, and dingle, have the same meaning. 
t The reader who has made the tour of this country, will 
recognise, in this description, the features which charac- 
terise the lower waterfall in the grounds of Rydal. 

AN EVENING WALK. 

Never shall ruthless minister of death 
'Mid thy soft glooms the glittering steel unsheath; 
No goblets shall, for thee, be crowned with flowers, 
No kid with piteous outcry thrill thy bowers ; 
The mystic shapes that by thy margin rove 
A more benignant sacrifice approve — 
I A mind, that, in a calm angelic mood 
Of happy wisdom, meditating good, 
Beholds, of all from her high powers required, 
Much done, and much designed, and more desired, — 
Harmonious thoughts, a soul by truth refined, 
Entire affection for all human kind. 
Dear Brook, farewell ! To-morrow's noon again 
Shall hide me, wooing long thy wildwood strain ; 
But now the sun has gained his western road, 
And eve's mild hour invites my steps abroad. 
While, near the midway cliff, the silvered kite 
In many a whistling circle wheels her flight ; 
Slant watery lights, from parting clouds, apace 
Travel along the precipice's base ; 
Cheering its naked waste of scattered stone, 
By lichens grey, and scanty moss, o'ergrown ; 
Where scarce the foxglove peeps, or thistle's beard ; 
And restless stone-chat, all day long, is heard. 
How pleasant, as the sun declines, to view 
The spacious landscape change in form and hue ! 
Here, vanish, as in mist, before a flood 
Of bright obscurity, hill, lawn, and wood ; 
There, objects, by the searching beams betrayed, 
Come forth, and here retire in purple shade ; 
Even the white stems of birch, the cottage white, 
Soften their glare before the mellow fight ; 
The skiffs, at anchor where with umbrage wide 
Yon chestnuts half the latticed boat-house hide, 
Shed from their sides, that face the sun's slant beam, 
Strong flakes of radiance on the tremulous stream : 
Raised by yon travelling flock, a dusty cloud 
Mounts from the road, and spreads its moving 
shroud ; 
The shepherd, all involved in wreaths of fire, 
Now shows a shadowy speck, and now is lost entire. 
Into a gradual calm the breezes sink, 
A blue rim borders all the lake's still brink ; 
There doth the twinkling aspen's foliage sleep, 
And insects clothe, like dust, the glassy deep : 
And now, on every side, the surface breaks 
Into blue spots, and slowly lengthening streaks ; 
Here, plots of sparkling water tremble bright 
With thousand thousand twinkling points of light ; 
There, waves that, hardly weltering, die away, 

Tip their smooth ridges with a softer ray ; 
And now the whole wide lake in deep repose 
Is hushed, and like a burnished mirror glows, 
Save where, along the shady western marge, 
Coasts, with industrious oar, the charcoal barge. 
Then' panniered train a group of potters goad, 
Winding from side to side up the steep road ; 
The peasant, from yon cliff of fearful edge 
Shot, down the headlong path darts with his sledge; 
Bright beams the lonely mountain-horse illume 
Feeding 'mid purple heath, "green lings," and 
broom ; 
While the sharp slope the slackened team confounds, 
Downward the ponderous timber-wain resounds ; 
In foamy breaks the rill, with merry song, 
Dashed o'er the rough rock, lightly leaps along ; 
From lonesome chapel at the mountain's feet, 
Three humble bells their rustic chime repeat ; 
Sounds from the water-side the hammered boat ; 
And Masted quarry thunders, heard remote ! 
Even here, amid the sweep of endless woods, 
Blue pomp of lakes, high cliffs, and falling floods, 
Not undefightful are the simplest charms, 
Found by the grassy door of mountain-farms. 
Sweetly ferociousf, round his native walks, 
Pride of his sister-wives, the monarch stalks ; 
Spur-clad his nervous feet, and firm his tread : 
■tf 
A crest of purple tops the warrior's head. 
Bright sparks Ins black and rolling eye-ball hurls 
Afar, his tail he closes and unfurls ; 
On tiptoe reared, he strains his clarion throat, 
Threatened by faintly-answering farms remote : 
Again with his shrill voice the mountain rings, 
While, flapped with conscious pride, resound Ins 
wings ! 
Where, mixed with graceful birch, the sombrous 
pine 
And yew-tree o'er the silver rocks recline ; 
I love to mark the quarry's moving trains, 
Dwarf panniered steeds, and men, and numerous 
wains : 
How busy all the enormous hive within, 
While Echo dallies with its various din ! 
Some (hear you not their chisels' clinking sound ?) 

 "Vivid rings of green." — greenwood's poem on 
SHOOTING. 
t " Dolcemente feroce." — Tasso. — In this description of 
the cock, I remembered a spirited one of the same anima] 
in L'Agriculture, ou Les Georgiques Francoises, of M. 
Rossuet. 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Toil, small as pigmies in the gulf profound ; 
Some, dim between the lofty cliffs descried, 
O'erwalk the slender plank from side to side ; 
These, by the pale-blue rocks that ceaseless ring, 
In airy baskets hanging, work and sing. 
Just where a cloud above the mountain rears 
An edge all flame, the broadening sun appears ; 
A long blue bar its segis orb divides, 
And breaks the spreading of its golden tides ; 
And now that orb has touched the purple steep 
Whose softened image penetrates the deep. 
'Cross the calm lake's blue shades the cliffs aspire, 
With towers and woods, a " prospect all on fire ; " 
While coves and secret hollows, through a ray 
Of fainter gold, a purple gleam betray. 
Each slip of lawn the broken rocks between 
Shines in the light with more than earthly green : 
Deep yellow beams the scattered stems illume, 
Far in the level forest's central gloom : 
Waving his hat, the shepherd, from the vale, 
Directs his winding dog the cliffs to scale, — 
The dog, loud barking, 'mid the glittering rocks, 
Hunts, where his master points, the intercepted 
flocks. 
Where oaks o'erhang the road the radiance shoots 
On tawny earth, wild weeds, and twisted roots ; 
The druid-stones a brightened ring unfold ; 
And all the babbling brooks are liquid gold ; 
Sunk to a curve, the day-star lessens still, 
Gives one bright glance, and drops behind the hill . 
In these secluded vales, if village fame, 
Confirmed by hoary hairs, belief may claim ; 
When up"the hills, as now, retired the light, 
Strange apparitions mocked the shepherd's sight. 
The form appears of one that spurs his steed 
Midway along the hill with desperate speed ; 
Unhurt pursues his lengthened flight, while all 
Attend, at every stretch, his headlong fall. 
Anon, appears a brave, a gorgeous show 
Of horsemen-shadows moving to and fro ; 
At intervals imperial banners stream, 
And now the van reflects the solar beam ; 
The rear through iron brown betrays a sullen gleam. 
While silent stands the admiring crowd below, 
Silent the visionary warriors go, 
Winding in ordered pomp their upward way •) 
Till the last banner of the long array 

 From Thomson. 
' f See a description of an appearance of this kind in 
Clark's Survey of the Lakes, accompanied by vouchers of 
its veracity, that may amuse the reader. 

Has disappeared, and every trace is fled 
Of splendor — save the beacon's spiry head 
Tipt with eve's latest gleam of burning red. 
Now, while the solemn evening shadows sail, 
On slowly-waving pinions, down the vale ; 
And, fronting the bright west, yon oak entwines, 
Its darkening boughs and leaves, in stronger lines ; 
'Tis pleasant near the tranquil lake to stray 
Where, winding on along some secret bay, 
The swan uplifts his chest, and backward flings 
His neck, a varying arch, between his towering 
wings : 
The eye that marks the gliding creature sees 
How graceful, pride can be, and how majestic, ease. 
While tender cares and mild domestic loves 
With furtive watch pursue her as she moves. 
The female with a meeker charm succeeds, 
And her brown little-ones around her leads, 
Nibbling the water lilies as they pass, 
Or playing wanton with the floating grass. 
She, in a mother's care, her beauty's pride 
Forgetting, calls the wearied to her side ; 
Alternately they mount her back, and rest 
Close by her mantling wings' embraces prest. 
Long may they float upon this flood serene ; 
Theirs be these holms untrodden, still, and green, 
Where leafy shades fence off the blustering gale, 
And breathes in peace the lily of the vale ! 
Yon isle, which feels not even the milk-maid's feet, 
Yet hears her song, " by distance made more sweet," 
Yon isle conceals their home, their hut-like bower ; 
Green water-rushes overspread the floor ; 
Long grass and willows form the woven wall, 
And swings above the roof the poplar tall. 
Thence issuing often with unwieldy stalk, 
They crush with brpad black feet then' flowery 
walk ; 
Or, from the neighbouring water, hear at mom 
The hound, the horse's tread, and mellow horn ; 
Involve their serpent-necks in changeful rings, 
Rolled wantonly between their slippery wings, 
Or, starting up with noise and rude delight, 
Force half upon the wave their cumbrous flight. 
Fair Swan ! by all a mother's joys caressed, 
Haply some wretch has eyed, and called thee 
blessed ; 
When with her infants, from some shady seat 
By the lake's edge, she rose — to face the noontide 
heat ; 
Or taught their limbs along the dusty road 
A few short steps to totter with their load. 

AN EVENING WALK. 

I see her now, denied to lay her head, 
On cold blue nights, in hut or straw-built shed, 
Turn to a silent smile their sleepy cry, 
By pointing to the gliding moon on high. 
— When low-hung clouds each star of summer hide, 
And fireless are the vallies far and wide, 
Where the brook brawls along the public road 
Dark with bat-haunted ashes stretching broad, 
Oft has she taught them on her lap to lay 
The shining glow-worm ; or, in heedless play, 
Toss it from hand to hand, disquieted ; 
While others, not unseen, are free to shed 
Green unmolested light upon their mossy bed. 
Oh ! when the sleety showers her path assail, 
And like a torrent roars the headstrong gale ; 
No more her breath can thaw their fingers cold, 
Their frozen arms her neck no more can fold ; 
Weak roof a cowering form two babes to shield, 
And faint the fire a dying heart can yield ! 
Press the sad kiss, fond mother ! vainly fears 
Thy flooded cheek to wet them with its tears ; 
No tears can chill them, and no bosom warms, 
Thy breast their death-bed, coffined in thine arms ! 
Sweet are the sounds that mingle from afar, 
Heard by calm lakes, as peeps the folding star, 
Where the duck dabbles 'mid the rustling sedge, 
And feeding pike starts from the water's edge, 
Or the swan stirs the reeds, Ins neck and bill 
Wetting, that drip upon the water still ; 
And heron, as resounds the trodden shore, 
Shoots upward, darting his long neck before. 
Now, with religious awe, the farewell light 
Blends with the solemn colouring of night ; 
'Mid groves of clouds that crest the mountain's brow, 
And round the west's proud lodge their shadows 
throw, 
Like Una shining on her gloomy way, 
The half-seen form of Twilight roams astray ; 
Shedding, through paly loop-holes mild and small, 
Gleams that upon the lake's still bosom fall ; 
Soft o'er the surface creep those lustres pale 
Tracking the motions of the fitful gale. 
With restless interchange at once the bright 
Wins on the shade, the shade upon the light. 
No favoured eye was e'er allowed to gaze 
On lovelier spectacle in faery days ; 
When gentle Spirits urged a sportive chase, 
Brushing with lucid wands the water's face ; 
While music, stealing round the glimmering deeps, 
Charmed the tall circle of the enchanted steeps. 
— The lights are vanished from the watery plains : 

No wreck of all the pageantry remains. 
Unheeded night has overcome the vales : 
On the dark earth the wearied vision fails ; 
The latest lingerer of the forest train, 
The lone black fir, forsakes the faded plain ; 
Last evening sight, the cottage smoke, no more, 
Lost in the thickened darkness, glimmers hoar ; 
And, towering from the sullen dark-brown mere, 
Like a black wall, the mountain-steeps appear. 
— Now o'er the soothed accordant heart we feel 
A sympathetic twilight slowly steal, 
And ever, as we fondly muse, we find 
The soft gloom deepening on the tranquil mind. 
Stay ! pensive, sadly-pleasing visions, stay ! 
Ah no ! as fades the vale, they fade away : 
Yet still the tender, vacant gloom remains ; 
Still the cold cheek its shuddering tear retains. 
The bird, who ceased, with fading light, to thread 
Silent the hedge or steamy rivulet's bed, 
From his grey re-appearing tower shall soon 
Salute with gladsome note the rising moon, 
While with a hoary fight she frosts the ground, 
And pours a deeper blue to ^Ether's bound ; 
Pleased, as she moves, her pomp of clouds to fold 
In robes of azure, fleecy -white, and gold. 
Above yon eastern hill, where darkness broods 
O'er all its vanished dells, and lawns, and woods ; 
Where but a mass of shade the sight can trace, 
Even now she shews, half-veiled, her lovely face : 
Across the gloomy valley flings her light, 
Far to the western slopes with hamlets white ; 
And gives, where woods the chequered upland strew, 
To the green com of summer, autumn's hue. 
Thus Hope, first pouring from her blessed horn 
Her dawn, far lovelier than the moon's own 
morn, 
'Till higher mounted, strives in vain to cheer 
The weary hil!s, impervious, blackening near ; 
Yet does she still, undaunted, throw the while 
On darling spots remote her tempting smile. 
Even now she decks for me a distant scene, 
(For dark and broad the gulf of time between) 
Gilding that cottage with her fondest ray, 
(Sole bourn, sole wish, sole object of my way ; 
How fan.' its lawns and sheltering woods appear ! 
How sweet its streamlet murmurs in mine ear !) 
Where we, my Friend, to happy days shall rise, 
'Till our small share of hardly-paining sighs 
(For sighs will ever trouble human breath) 
Creep hushed into the tranquil breast of death. 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

But now the clear bright Moon her zenith gains, 
And, rimy without speck, extend the plains : 
The deepest cleft the mountain's front displays 
Scarce hides a shadow from her searching rays ; 
From the dark-blue faint silvery threads divide 
The hflls, while gleams below the azure tide ; 
Time softly treads ; throughout the landscape 
breathes 
A peace enlivened, not disturbed, by wreaths 
Of charcoal-smoke, that o'er the fallen wood, 
Steal down the hill, and spread along the flood. 
The song of mountain-streams, unheard by day, 
Now hardly heard, beguiles my homeward way. 
Ah' listens, like the sleeping water, still, 
To catch the spiritual music of the hill, 
Broke only by the slow clock tolling deep, 
Or shout that wakes the ferry-man from sleep, 
The echoed hoof nearing the distant shore, 
The boat's first motion — made with dashing oar : 
Sound of closed gate, across the water borne, 
Hurrying the timid hare through rustling corn ; 
The sportive outcry of the mocking owl ; 
And at long intervals the mill-dog's howl ; 
The distant forge's swinging thump profound ; 
Or yell, in the deep woods, of lonely hound.

LINES 
WRITTEN WHTLE SAILING IN A BOAT AT EVENING. 
How richly glows the water's breast 
Before us, tinged with evening hues, 
While, facing thus the crimson west, 
The boat her silent course pursues ! 
And see how dark the backward stream ! 
A little moment past so smiling ! 
And still, perhaps, with faithless gleam, 
Some other loiterers beguiling. 
Such views the youthful Bard allure ; 
But, heedless of the following gloom, 
He deems their colours shall endure 
Till peace go with him to the tomb. 
— And let him nurse his fond deceit, 
And what if he must die in sorrow ! 
Who would not cherish dreams so sweet, 
Though grief and pain may come to-morrow I

REMEMBRANCE OF COLLINS, 
COMPOSED UPON THE THAMES NEAR RICHMOND. 
Glide gently, thus for ever glide, 
Thames ! that other bards may see 
As lovely visions by thy side 
As now, fair river ! come to me. 
glide, fair stream ! for ever so, 
Thy quiet soul on all bestowing, 
Till all our minds for ever flow 
As thy deep waters now are flowing. 
Vain thought ! — Yet be as now thou art, 
That in thy waters may be seen 
The image of a poet's heart, 
How bright, how solemn, how serene ! 
Such as did once the Poet bless, 
Who murmuring here a later ditty, 
Could find no refuge from distress 
But in the milder grief of pity. 
Now let us, as we float along, 
For Mm suspend the dashing oar ; 
And pray that never child of song 
May know that Poet's sorrows more. 
How calm ! how still ! the only sound, 
The dripping of the oar suspended ! 
— The evening darkness gathers round 
By virtue's holiest Powers attended.

VI. 
DESCRIPTIVE SKETCHES 
TAKEN 
DURING A PEDESTRIAN TOUR AMONG THE ALPS. 

TO 
THE REV. ROBERT JONES, 
FELLOW OF ST. JOHIl's COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE. 
Dear Sib, 
However desirous I might have been of giving 
you proofs of the high place you hold in my esteem, I 
should have been cautious of wounding your delicacy by 
thus publicly addressing you, had not the circumstance of 
our having been companions among the Alps, seemed to 
give this dedication a propriety sufficient to do away any 
scruples which your modesty might otherwise have 
suggested. 

 Collins's Ode on the death of Thomson, the last writ- 
ten, I believe, of the poems which were published during 
his life-time. This Ode is also alluded to in the next stanza. 

DESCRIPTIVE SKETCHES, &c. 

In inscribing thislittle work to you, I consult my heart. 
You know well how great is the difference between two 
companions lolling in a post-chaise, and two travellers 
plodding slowly along the road, side by side, each with 
his little knapsack of necessaries upon his shoulders. How 
much more of heart between the two latter ! 
I am happy in being conscious that I shall have one 
reader who will approach the conclusion of thesefew pages 
with regret. You they must certainly interest, in remind- 
ing you of moments to which you can hardly look back 
without a pleasure not the less dear from a shade of me- 
lancholy. You will meet with few images without recol- 
lecting the spot where we observed them together ; 
consequently, whatever is feeble in my design, or spiritless 
in my colouring, will be amply supplied by your own 
memory. 
With still greater propriety I might have inscribed to 
you a description of some of the features of your native 
mountains, through which we have wandered together, in 
the same manner, with so much pleasure. But the sea- 
sunsets, which give such splendour to the vale of Chvyd, 
Snowdon, the chair of Idris, the quiet village of Bethgelert, 
Menai and her Druids, the Alpine steeps of the Conway, 
and the still more interesting windings of the wizard stream 
of the Dee, remain yet untouched. Apprehensive that 
my pencil may never be exercised on these subjects, I 
cannot let slip this opportunity of thus publicly assuring 
you with how much affection and esteem 
I am, dear Sir, 
Most sincerely yours, 
W. WORDSWORTH.

Conclusion. 
Were there, below, a spot of holy ground 
Where from distress a refuge might be found, 
And solitude prepare the soul for heaven ; 
Sure, nature's God that spot to man had given 
Where falls the purple morning far and wide 
In flakes of light upon the mountain side ; 
Where with loud voice the power of water shakes 
The leafy wood, or sleeps in quiet lakes. 
Yet not unrecompensed the man shall roam, 
Who at the call of summer quits his home, 

And plods through some wide realm o'er vale and 
height, 
Though seeking only holiday delight ; 
At least, not owning to himself an aim 
To which the sage would give a prouder name. 
No gains too cheaply earned his fancy cloy, 
Though every passing zephyr whispers joy ; 
Brisk toil, alternating with ready ease, 
Feeds the clear current of his sympathies. 
For him sod-seats the cottage-door adorn ; 
And peeps the far-off spire, his evening bourn ! 
Dear is the forest frowning o'er his head, 
And dear the velvet green-sward to his tread : 
Moves there a cloud o'er mid-day's flaming eye I 
Upward he looks — " and calls it luxury :" 
Kind Nature's charities his steps attend ; 
In every babbling brook he finds a friend ; 
While chastening thoughts of sweetest use,bestowed 
By wisdom, moralise his pensive road. 
Host of his welcome inn, the noon-tide bower, 
To his spare meal he calls the passing poor ; 
He views the sun uplift his golden fire, 
Or sink, with heart alive like Memnon's lyre ; 
Blesses the moon that comes with kindly ray, 
To fight him shaken by his rugged way. 
Back from his sight no bashful children steal ; 
He sits a brother at the cottage-meal ; 
His humble looks no shy restraint impart ; 
Around him plays at will the virgin heart. 
While unsuspended wheels the village dance, 
The maidens eye him with enquiring glance, 
Much wondering by what fit of crazing care, 
Or desperate love, bewildered, he came there. 
A hope, that prudence could not then approve, 
That clung to Nature with a truant's love, 
O'er Gallia's wastes of corn my footsteps led ; 
Her files of road-elms, high above my head 
In long-drawn vista, rustling in the breeze ; 
Or where her pathways straggle as they please 
By lonely farms and secret villages. 
But lo ! the Alps ascending white in air, 
Toy with the sun and glitter from afar. 
And now, emerging from the forest's gloom, 
I greet thee, Chartreuse, while I mourn thy doom. 
Whither is fled that Power whose frown severe 
Awed sober Reason till she crouched in fear ? 
That Silence, once in deathlike fetters bound, 
Chains that were loosened only by the sound 
Of holv rites chanted in measured round % 

 The lyre of Memnon is reported to have emitted 
melancholy or cheerful tones, as it was touched by the 
sun's evening or morning rays. 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

— The voice of blasphemy the fane alarms, 
The cloister startles at the gleam of arms. 
The thundering tube the aged angler hears, 
Bent o'er the groaning flood that sweeps away his 
tears. 
Cloud-piercing pine-trees nod their troubled heads, 
Spires, rocks, and lawns a browner night o'er- 
spreads ; 
Strong terror checks the female peasant's sighs, 
And start the astonished shades at female eyes. 
From Bruno's forest screams the affrighted jay, 
And slow the insulted eagle wheels away. 
A viewless flight of laughing Demons mock 
The Cross, by angels planted on the aerial rock. 
The "parting Genius " sighs with hollow breath 
Along the mystic streams of Life and Death . 
Swelling the outcry dull, that long resounds 
Portentous through her old woods' trackless 
bounds, 
Vallombre J, 'mid her falling fanes, deplores, 
For ever broke, the sabbath of her bowers. 
More pleased, my foot the hidden margin roves 
Of Como, bosomed deep in chestnut groves. 
No meadows thrown between, the giddy steeps 
Tower, bare or sylvan, from the narrow deeps. 
— To towns, whose shades of no rude noise com- 
plain, 
From ringing team apart and grating wain — 
To flat-roofed towns, that touch the water's bound, 
Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound, 
Or, from the bending rocks, obtrusive cling, 
And o'er the whitened wave their shadows fling — 
The pathway leads, as round the steeps it twines ; 
And Silence loves its purple roof of vines. 
The loitering traveller hence, at evening, sees 
From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees ; 
Or marks, 'mid opening cliffs, fair dark-eyed maids 
Tend the small harvest of then garden glades ; 
Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view 
Stretch o'er the pictured mirror broad and blue, 
And track the yellow lights from steep to steep, 
As up the opposing hills they slowly creep. 
Aloft, here, half a village shines, arrayed 
In golden light ; half hides itself in shade : 
While, from amid the darkened roofs, the spire, 
Restlessly flashing, seems to mount like fire : 
There, all unshaded, blazing forests throw 
Rich golden verdure on the lake below. 

 Alluding to crosses seen on the tops of the spiry rocks 
of Chartreuse, which have every appearance of being 
inaccessible. 
f Names of rivers at the Chartreuse. 
t Name of one of the valleys of the Chartreuse. 

Slow glides the sail along the illumined shore, 
And steals into the shade the lazy oar ; 
Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs,. 
And amorous music on the water dies. 
How blest, delicious scene ! the eye that greets 
Thy open beauties, or thy lone retreats ; 
Beholds the unwearied sweep of wood that scales 
Thy cliffs ; the endless waters of thy vales ; 
Thy lowly cots that sprinkle all the shore, 
Each with its household boat beside the door ; 
Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky ; 
Thy towns, that cleave, like swallows' nests, on 
high ; 
That glimmer hoar in eve's last light, descried 
Dim from the twilight water's shaggy side, 
Whence lutes and voices down the enchanted 
woods 
Steal, and compose the oar-forgotten floods ; 
— Thy lake, that, streaked or dappled, blue or 
grey, 
'Mid smoking woods gleams hid from morning's ray 
Slow- travelling down the western hills, to' enfold 
Its green-tinged margin in a blaze of gold ; 
Thy glittering steeples, whence the matin bell 
Calls forth the woodman from his desert cell, 
And quickens the blithe sound of oars that pass 
Along the steaming lake, to early mass. 
But now farewell to each and all — adieu 
To every charm, and last and chief to you, 
Ye lovely maidens that hi noontide shade 
Rest near your little plots of wheaten glade ; 
To all that binds the soul in powerless trance, 
Lip-dewing song, and ringlet-tossing dance ; 
Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume 
The sylvan cabin's lute-enlivened gloom. 
— Alas ! the very murmur of the streams 
Breathes o'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams, 
While Slavery, forcing the sunk mind to dwell 
On joys that might disgrace the captive's cell, 
Her shameless timbrel shakes on Como's marge, 
And lures from bay to bay the vocal barge. 
Yet are thy softer arts with power indued 
To soothe and cheer the poor man's solitude. 
By silent cottage-doors, the peasant's home 
Left vacant for the day, I loved to roam. 
But once I pierced the mazes of a wood 
In which a cabin undeserted stood ; 
There an old man an olden measure scanned 
On a rude viol touched with withered hand. 
As lambs or fawns m April clustering lie 
Under a hoary oak's thin canopy, 
Stretched at his feet, with stedfast upward eye, 

DESCRIPTIVE SKETCHES, &c. 

His children's children listened to the sound ; 
— A Hermit with his family around ! 
But let us hence ; for fair Locarno smiles 
Embowered in walnut slopes and citron isles : 
Or seek at eve the banks of Tusa's stream, 
Where, 'mid dim towers and woods, her waters 
gleam. 
From the bright wave, in solemn gloom, retire 
The dull-red steeps, and, darkening still, aspire 
To where afar rich orange lustres glow 
Round undistinguished clouds, and rocks, and 
snow : 
Or, led where Via MaJa's chasms confine 
The indignant waters of the infant Rhine, 
Hang o'er the abyss, whose else impervious gloom 
His burning eyes with fearful light illume. 
The mind condemned, without reprieve, to go 
O'er life's long deserts with its charge of woe, 
With sad congratulation joins the train 
Where beasts and men together o'er the plain 
Move on— a mighty caravan of pain : 
Hope, strength, and courage, social suffering 
brings, 
Freshening (.he wilderness with shades and springs. 
— There be whose lot far otherwise is cast : 
Sole human tenant of the piny waste, 
By choice or doom a gipsy wanders here, 
A nursling babe her only comforter ; 
Lo, where she sits beneath yon shaggy rock, 
A cowering shape half hid in curling smoke ! 
When lightning among clouds and mountain- 
snows 
Predominates, and darkness comes and goes, 
And the fierce torrent, at the flashes broad 
Starts, like a horse, beside the glaring road — 
She seeks a covert from the battering shower 
In the roofed bridge f ; the bridge, in that dread 
hour, 
Itself all trembling at the torrent's power. 
Nor is she more at ease on some still night, 
When not a star supplies the comfort of its light ; 
Only the waning moon hangs dull and red 
Above a melancholy mountain's head, 
Then sets. In total gloom the Vagrant sighs, 
Stoops her sick head, and shuts her weary eyes ; 
 The river along whose banks you descend in crossing 
the Alps by the Simplon Pass. 
t Most of the bridges among the Alps are of wood, and 
covered : these bridges have a heavy appearance, and 
rather injure the effect of the scenery in some places. 

Or on her fingers counts the distant clock, 
Or, to the drowsy crow of midnight cock, 
Listens, or quakes while from the forest's gulf 
Howls near and nearer yet the famished wolf. 
From the green vale of Urseren smooth and wide 
Descend we now, the maddened Reuss our guide ; 
By rocks that, shutting out the blessed day, 
Cling tremblingly to rocks as loose as they ; 
By cells upon whose image, while he prays, 
The kneeling peasant scarcely dares to gaze ; 
By many a votive death-cross -(- planted near, 
And watered duly with the pious tear, 
That faded silent from the upward eye 
Unmoved with each rude form of peril nigh ; 
Fixed on the anchor left by Him who saves 
Alike in whelming snows, and roaring waves. 
But soon a peopled region on the sight 
Opens — a little world of calm delight ; 
Where mists, suspended on the expiring gale, 
Spread rooflike o'er the deep secluded vale, 
And beams of evening slipping in between, 
Gently illuminate a sober scene : — 
Here, on the brown wood-cottages J they sleep, 
There, over rock or sloping pasture creep. 
On as we journey, in clear view displayed, 
The still vale lengthens underneath its shade 
Of low-hung vapour : on the freshened mead 
The green light sparkles ; — the dim bowers recede. 
While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull, 
And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull, 
In solemn shapes before the admiring eye 
Dilated hang the misty pines on high, 
Huge convent domes with pinnacles and towers, 
And antique castles seen through gleamy showers. 
From such romantic dreams, my soul, awake ! 
To sterner pleasure, where, by Uri's lake 
In Nature's pristine majesty outspread, 
Winds neither road nor path for foot to tread : 
The rocks rise naked as a wall, or stretch, 
Far o'er the water, hung with groves of beech ; 
Aerial pines from loftier steeps ascend, 
Nor stop but where creation seems to end. 
Yet here and there, if mid the savage scene 
Appears a scanty plot of smiling green, 

 The Catholic religion prevails here : these cells are, as 
is well known, very common in the Catholic countries, 
planted, like the Roman tombs, along the road side. 
f Crosses, commemorative of the deaths of travellers 
by the fall of snow, and other accidents, are very common 
along this dreadful road. 
% The houses in the more retired Swiss valleys are all 
built of wood. 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Up from the lake a zigzag path will creep 
To reach a small wood-hut hung boldly on the steep. 
— Before those thresholds (never can they know 
The face of traveller passing to and fro,) 
No peasant leans upon his pole, to tell 
For whom at morning tolled the funeral bell ; 
Their watch-dog ne'er his angry bark foregoes, 
Touched by the beggar's moan of human woes ; 
The shady porch ne'er offered a cool seat 
To pilgrims overcome by summer's heat. 
Yet thither the world's business finds its way 
At times, and tales unsought beguile the day, 
And there are those fond thoughts which Solitude, 
However stern, is powerless to exclude. 
There doth the maiden watch her lover's sail 
Approaching, and upbraid the tardy gale ; 
At midnight listens till his parting oar, 
And its last echo, can be heard no more. 
And what if ospreys, cormorants, herons cry, 
Amid tempestuous vapours driving by, 
Or hovering over wastes too bleak to rear 
That common growth of earth, the foodful ear ; 
Where the green apple shrivels on the spray, 
And pines the unripened pear in summer's kindliest 
ray; 
Contentment shares the desolate domain 
With Independence, child of high Disdain. 
Exulting 'mid the winter of the skies, 
Shy as the jealous chamois, Freedom flies, 
And grasps by fits her sword, and often eyes ; 
And sometimes, as from rock to rock she bounds 
The Patriot nymph starts at imagined sounds, 
And, wildly pausing, oft she hangs aghast, 
Whether some old Swiss air hath checked her haste 
Or thrill of Spartan fife is caught between the blast. 
Swoln with incessant rains from hour to hour, 
All day the floods a deepening murmur pour : 
The sky is veiled, and every cheerful sight : 
Dark is the region as with coming night ; 
But what a sudden burst of overpowering light ! 
Triumphant on the bosom of the storm, 
Glances the wheeling eagle's glorious form ! 
Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine 
The wood-crowned cliffs that o'er the lake recline ; 
Those lofty cliffs a hundred streams unfold, 
At once to pillars turned that flame with gold : 
Behind his sail the peasant shrinks, to shim 
The west, that burns like one dilated sun, 
A crucible of mighty compass, felt 
By mountains, glowing till they seem to melt. 
But, lo ! the boatman, overawed, before 
The pictured fane of Tell suspends his oar ; 

Confused the Marathonian tale appears, 
While his eyes sparkle with heroic tears. 
And who, that walks where men of ancient days 
Have wrought with godlike arm the deeds of praise 
Feels not the spirit of the place control, 
Or rouse and agitate his labouring soul ? 
Say, who, by thinking on Canadian hills, 
Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills, 
On Zutphen's plain ; or on that highland dell, 
Through which rough Garry cleaves his way, can tell 
What high resolves exalt the tenderest thought 
Of him whom passion rivets to the spot, 
Where breathed the gale that caught Wolfe's hap- 
piest sigh, 
And the last sunbeam fell on Bayard's eye ; 
Where bleeding Sidney from the cup retired, 
And glad Dundee in "faint huzzas " expired ? 
But now with other mind I stand alone 
Upon the summit of this naked cone, 
And watch the fearless chamois-hunter chase 
His prey, through tracts abrupt of desolate space, 
 Through vacant worlds where Nature never gave 
A brook to murmur or a bough to wave, 
Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep ; 
Thro' worlds where Life, and Voice, and Motion 
sleep ; 
Where silent Hours then' death-like sway extend, 
Save when the avalanche breaks loose, to rend 
Its way with uproar, till the ruin, drowned 
In some dense wood or gulf of snow profound, 
Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive 
sound. 
— 'Tis his, while wandering on from height to 
height, 
To see a planet's pomp and steady light 
In the least star of scarce-appearing night ; 
While the pale moon moves near him, on the bound 
Of ether, shining with diminished round, 
And far and wide the icy summits blaze, 
Rejoicing in the glory of her rays : 
To him the day-star glitters small and bright, 
Shorn of its beams, insufferably white, 
And he can look beyond the sun, and view 
Those fast-receding depths of sable blue 
Flying till vision can no more pursue ! 
— At once bewildering mists around him close, 
And cold and hunger are his least of woes ; 
The Demon of the snow, with angry roar 
Descending, shuts for aye his prison door. 
Soon with despair's whole weight his spirits sink ; 

 For most of the images in the next sixteen verses, I 
am indebted to M. Raymond's interesting observations 
annexed to his translation of Coxe's Tour in Switzerland. 

DESCRIPTIVE SKETCHES, &c. 

 

Bread has he none, the snow must be his drink ; 
And, ere his eyes can close upon the day, 
The eagle of the Alps o'ershades her prey. 
Now couch thyself where, heard with fear afar, 
Thunders through echoing pines the headlong Aar ; 
Or rather stay to taste the mild delights 
Of pensive Underwalden's pastoral heights. 
— Is there who 'mid these awful wilds has seen 
The native Genii walk the mountain green % 
Or heard, while other worlds their charms reveal, 
Soft music o'er the aerial summit steal ? 
While o'er the desert, answering every close, 
Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes. 
— And sure there is a secret Power that reigns 
Here, where no trace of man the spot profanes, 
Nought but the chalets^, flat and bare, on high 
Suspended 'mid the quiet of the sky ; 
Or distant herds that pasturing upward creep, 
And, not untended, climb the dangerous steep. 
How still ! no irreligious sound or sight 
Rouses the soul from her severe delight. 
An idle voice the sabbath region fills 
Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills, 
And with that voice accords the soothing sound 
Of drowsy bells, for ever tinkling round ; 
Faint wail of eagle melting into blue 
Beneath the cliffs, and pine-woods' steady sughX; 
The solitary heifer's deepened low ; 
Or rumbling, heard remote, of falling snow. 
All motions, sounds, and voices, far and nigh, 
Blend in a music of tranquillity ; 
Save when, a stranger seen below, the boy 
Shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy. 
When, from the sunny breast of open seas, 
And bays with myrtle fringed, the southern breeze 
Comes on to gladden April with the sight 
Of green isles widening on each snow-clad height : 
When shouts and lowing herds the valley fill, 
And louder torrents stun the noon-tide hill, 
The pastoral Swiss begin the cliffs to scale, 
Leaving to silence the deserted vale ; 
And like the Patriarchs in their simple age 
Move, as the verdure leads, from stage to stage ; 
High and more high in summer's heat they go, 

 The people of this Canton are supposed to be of a more 
melancholy disposition than the other inhabitants of the 
Alps ; this, if true, may proceed from their living more 
secluded. 
t This picture is from the middle region of the Alps. 
Chalets are summer huts for the Swiss herdsmen. 
t Sugh, a Scotch word expressive of the sound of the 
wind through the trees. 

And hear the rattling thunder far below ; 
Or steal beneath the mountains, half-deterred, 
Where huge rocks tremble to the bellowing herd. 
One I behold who, 'cross the foaming flood, 
Leaps with a bound of graceful hardihood ; 
Another high on that green ledge ; — he gained 
The tempting spot with every sinew strained ; 
And downward thence a knot of grass he throws, 
Foo<? .ur his beasts in time of winter snows. 
— Far different fife from what Tradition hoar 
Transmits of happier lot in times of yore ! 
Then Summer lingered long ; and honey flowed 
From out the rocks, the wild bees' safe abode : 
Continual waters welling cheered the waste, 
And plants were wholesome, now of deadly taste : 
Nor Winter yet his frozen stores had piled, 
Usurping where the fairest herbage smiled : 
Nor Hunger driven the herds from pastures bare, 
To climb the treacherous cliffs for scanty fare. 
Then the milk-thistle flourished through the land, 
And forced the full-swoln udder to demand, 
Thrice every day, the pail and welcome hand. 
Thus does the father to his children tell 
Of banished bliss, by fancy loved too well. 
Alas ! that human guilt provoked the rod 
Of angry Nature to avenge her God. 
Still, Nature, ever just, to liim imparts 
Joys only given to uncorrupted hearts. 
'Tis morn : with gold the verdant mountain 
glows ; 
More high, the snowy peaks with hues of rose. 
Far-stietched beneath the many-tinted hills, 
A mighty waste of mist the valley fills, 
A solemn sea ! whose billows wide around 
Stand motionless, to awful silence bound : 
Pines, on the coast, through mist then.' tops uprear, 
That like to leaning masts of stranded ships appear. 
A single chasm, a gulf of gloomy blue, 
Gapes in the centre of the sea — and through 
That dark mysterious gulf ascending, sound 
Innumerable streams with roar profound. 
Mount through the nearer vapours notes of birds, 
And merry flageolet ; the low of herds, 
The bark of dogs, the heifer's tinkling bell, 
Talk, laughter, and perchance a church-tower knell : 
Think not, the peasant from aloft has gazed 
And heard with heart unmoved, with soul unraised : 
Nor is his spirit less enrapt, nor less 
Alive to independent happiness, 
Then, when he lies, out-stretched, at even-tide 
Upon the fragrant mountain's purple side : 
For as the pleasures of his simple day 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Beyond his native valley seldom stray, 
Nought round its darling precincts can he find 
But hrings some past enjoyment to his mind ; 
While Hope, reclining upon Pleasure's urn, 
Binds her wild wreaths, and whispers his return. 
Once, Man entirely free, alone and wild, 
Was West as free — for he was Nature's child. 
He, all superior hut his God disdained, 
Walked none restraining, and by none restrained: 
Confessed no law but what his reason taught, 
Did all he wished, and wished but what he ought. 
As man in his primeval dower arrayed 
The image of his glorious Sire displayed, 
Even so, by faithful Nature guarded, here 
The traces of primeval Man appear ; 
The simple dignity no forms debase ; 
The eye sublime, and surly lion-grace : 
The slave of none, of beasts alone the lord, 
His book he prizes, nor neglects his sword ; 
— Well taught by that to feel his rights, prepared 
With this "the blessings he enjoys to guard." 
And, as his native hills encircle ground 
For many a marvellous victory renowned, 
The work of Freedom daring to oppose, 
With few in arms , innumerable foes, 
When to those famous fields his steps are led, 
An unknown power connects him with the dead : 
For images of other worlds are there ; 
Awful the light, and holy is the air. 
Fitfully, and in flashes, through his soul, 
Like sun-lit tempests, troubled transports roll ; 
His bosom heaves, his Spirit towers amain, 
Beyond the senses and their little reign. 
And oft, when that dread vision hath past by, 
He holds with God himself communion high, 
There where the peal of swelling torrents fills 
The sky-roofed temple of the eternal hills ; 
Or, when upon the mountain's silent brow 
Reclined, he sees, above him and below, 
Bright stars of ice and azure fields of snow ; 
While needle peaks of granite shooting bare 
Tremble in ever- varying tints of air. 

 Alluding to several battles which the Swiss in very 
small numbers have gained over their oppressors, the 
house of Austria ; and, in particular, to one fought at 
Naeffels near Glarus, where three hundred and thirty men 
are said to have defeated an army of between fifteen and 
twenty thousand Austrians. Scattered over the valley are 
to he found eleven stones, with this inscription, , the 
year the battle was fought, marking out, as I was told upon 
the spot, the several places where the Austrians,attempting 
to make a stand, were repulsed anew. 

And when a gathering weight of shadows brown 
Falls on the valleys as the sun goes down ; 
And Pikes, of darkness named and fear and 
storms , 
Uplift in quiet their illumined forms, 
In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread, 
Tinged like an angel's smile all rosy red — 
Awe in his breast with holiest love unites, 
And the near heavens impart their own delights. 
When downward to his winter hut he goes, 
Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows ; 
That hut which on the hills so oft employs 
His thoughts, the central point of all his joys. 
And as a swallow, at the hour of rest, 
Peeps often ere she darts into her nest, 
So to the homestead, where the grandsire tends 
A little prattling child, he oft descends, 
To glance a look upon the well-matched pair; 
Till storm and driving ice blockade him there. 
There, safely guarded by the woods behind, 
He hears the chiding of the baffled wind, 
Hears Winter calling all his terrors round, 
And, blest within himself, he shrinks not from the 
sound. 
Through Nature's vale his homely pleasures 
glide, 
Unstained by envy, discontent, and pride ; 
The bound of all his vanity, to deck, 
With one bright bell, a favourite heifer's neck ; 
Well pleased upon some simple annual feast, 
Remembered half the year and hoped the rest, 
If dairy-produce, from his inner hoard, 
Of thrice ten summers dignify the board. 
— Alas ! in every clime a flying ray 
Is all we have to cheer our wintry way ; 
And here the unwilling mind may more than 
trace 
The general sorrows of the human race : 
The churlish gales of penury, that blow 
Cold as the north-wind o'er a waste of snow, 
To them the gentle groups of bliss deny 
That on the noon-day bank of leisure he. 
Yet more ; — compelled by Powers which only 

That solitary man disturb their reign, 
Powers that support an unremitting strife 
With all the tender charities of life, 
Full oft the father, when his sons have grown 
To manhood, seems then title to disown ; 

 As Schreck-Horn, the pike of terror; Wetter-Horn, 
the pike of storms, &c. &c. 

DESCRIPTIVE SKETCHES, &c. 

 

And from his nest amid the storms of heaven 
Drives, eagle-like, those sons as he was driven ; 
With stem composure watches to the plain — 
And never, eagle-like, beholds again ! 
When long-familiar joys are all resigned, 
Why does their sad remembrance haunt the mind ? 
Lo ! where through flat Batavia's willowy groves, 
Or by the lazy Seine, the exile roves ; 
O'er the curled waters Alpine measures swell, 
And search the affections to their inmost cell ; 
Sweet poison spreads along the listener's veins, 
Turning past pleasures into mortal pains ; 
Poison, which not a frame of steel can brave, 
Bows his young head with sorrow to the grave. 
Gay lark of hope, thy silent song resume ! 
Ye flattering eastern lights, once more the hills 
illume ! 
Fresh gales and dews of life's delicious morn. 
And thou, lost fragrance of the heart, return ! 
Alas ! the little joy to man allowed, 
Fades like the lustre of an evening cloud ; 
Or like the beauty in a flower installed, 
Whose season was, and cannot be recalled. 
Yet, when opprest by sickness, grief, or care, 
And taught that pain is pleasure's natural heir, 
We still confide in more than we can know ; 
Death would be else the favourite friend of woe. 
. 'Mid savage rocks, and seas of snow that shine, 
Between interminable tracts of pine, 
Within a temple stands an awful shrine, 
By an uncertain light revealed, that falls 
On the mute Image and the troubled walls. 
Oh ! give not me that eye of hard disdain 
That views, undimmed, Einsiedlen's f wretched 
fane. 
While ghastly faces through the gloom appear, 
Abortive joy, and hope that works in fear ; 
While prayer contends with silenced agony, 
Surely in other thoughts contempt may die. 
If the sad grave of human ignorance bear 
One flower of hope — oh, pass and leave it there ! 
The tall sun, pausing on an Alpine spire, 
Flings o'er the wilderness a stream of fire : 
Now meet we other pilgrims ere the day 
Close on the remnant of their weary way ; 

 The well-known effect of. the famous air, called in 
French Ranz des Vaches, upon the Swiss troops. 
t This shrine is resorted to, from a hope of relief, by 
multitudes, from every corner of the Catholic world, 
labouring under mental or bodily afflictions. 

While they are drawing toward the sacred floor 
Where, so they fondly think, the worm shall gnaw- 
no more. 
How gaily murmur and how sweetly taste 
The fountains reared for them amid the waste ! 
Their thirst they slake : — they wash their toil- 
worn feet, 
And some with tears of joy each other greet. 
Yes, I must see you when ye first behold 
Those holy turrets tipped with evening gold, 
In that glad moment will for you a sigh 
Be heaved, of charitable sympathy ; 
In that glad moment when your hands are prest 
In mute devotion on the thankful breast ! 
Last, let us turn to Chamouny that shields 
With rocks and gloomy woods her fertile fields : 
Five streams of ice amid her cots descend, 
And with wild flowers and blooming orchards 
blend ; — 
A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns 
Of purple fights and ever- vernal plains ; 
Here all the seasons revel hand in hand : 
'Mid lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fanned, 
They sport beneath that mountain's matchless 
height 
That holds no commerce with the summer night. 
From age to age, throughout his lonely bounds 
The crash of ruin fitfully resounds ; 
Appalling havoc ! but serene his brow, 
Where daylight lingers on perpetual snow ; 
Glitter the stars above, and all is black below. 
What marvel then if many a Wanderer sigh, 
While roars the sullen Arve in anger by, 
That not for thy reward, unrivalled Vale ! 
Waves the ripe harvest in the autumnal gale ; 
That thou, the slave of slaves, art doomed to pine 
And droop, while no Italian arts are thine, 
To soothe or cheer, to soften or refine. 
Hail Freedom ! whether it was mine to stray, 
With shrill winds whistling round my lonely way, 
On the bleak sides of Cumbria's heath-clad moors, 
Or where dank sea-weed lashes Scotland's shores ; 
To scent the sweets of Piedmont's breathing rose, 
And orange gale that o'er Lugano blows ; 
Still have I found, where Tyranny prevails, 
That virtue languishes and pleasure fails, 
While the remotest hamlets blessings share 
In thy loved presence known, and only there ; 

 Rude fountains built and covered with sheds for 
the accommodation of the Pilgrims, in their ascent of the 
mountain. 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Heart-blessings- — outward treasures too which the 
eye 
Of the sun peeping through the clouds can spy, 
And every passing breeze will testify. 
There, to the porch, belike with jasmine bound 
Or woodbine wreaths, a smoother path is wound ; 
The housewife there a brighter garden sees, 
Where hum on busier wing her happy bees ; 
On infant cheeks there fresher roses blow ; 
And grey-haired men look up with livelier brow, — 
To greet the traveller needing food and rest ; 
Housed for the night, or but a half-hour's guest. 
And oh, fair France ! though now the traveller sees 
Thy three- striped banner fluctuate on the breeze ; 
Though martial songs have banished songs of love, 
And nightingales desert the village grove, 
Scared by the fife and rumbling drum's alarms, 
And the short thunder, and the flash of arms ; 
That cease not till night falls, when far and nigh, 
Sole sound, the Sourd prolongs his mournful cry ! 
— Yet, hast thou found that Freedom spreads her 
power 
Beyond the cottage-hearth, the cottage-door : 
All nature smiles, and owns beneath her eyes 
Her fields peculiar, and peculiar skies. 
Yes, as I roamed where Loiret's waters glide 
Through rustling aspens heard from side to side, 
When from October clouds a milder light 
Fell where the blue flood rippled into white ; 
Methought from every cot the watchful bird 
Crowed with ear-piercing power till then unheard ; 
Each clacking mill, that broke the murmuring 
streams, 
Rocked the charmed thought in more delightful 
dreams ; 
Chasing those pleasant dreams, the falling leaf 
Awoke a fainter sense of moral grief ; 
The measured echo of the distant flail 
Wound in more welcome cadence down the vale ; 
With more majestic course the water rolled, 
And ripening foliage shone with richer gold. 
— But foes are gathering — Liberty must raise 
Red on the hills her beacon's far-seen blaze ; 
Must bid the tocsin ring from tower to tower ! — 
Nearer and nearer comes the trying hour ! 
Rejoice, brave Land, though pride's perverted ire 

 An insect so called, which emits a short, melancholy 
cry, heard at the close of the summer evenings, on the 
banks of the Loire. 
t The duties upon many parts of the French rivers were 
so exorbitant, that the poorer people, deprived of the 
benefit of water carriage, were obliged to transport their 
goods by land: 

Rouse hell's own aid, and wrap thy fields in fire : 
Lo, from the flames a great and glorious birth ; 
As if a new-made heaven were hailing a new earth ! 
— All cannot be : the promise is too fair 
For creatures doomed to breathe terrestrial air : 
Yet not for this will sober reason frown 
Upon that promise, nor the hope disown ; 
She knows that only from high aims ensue 
Rich guerdons, and to them alone are due. 
Great God ! by whom the strifes of men are 
weighed 
In an impartial balance, give thine aid 
To the just cause ; and, oh ! do thou preside 
Over the mighty stream now spreading wide : 
So shall its waters, from the heavens supplied 
In copious showers, from earth by wholesome 
springs, 
Brood o'er the long-parched lands with Nile-like 
wings ! 
And grant that every sceptred child of clay 
Who cries presumptuous, " Here the flood shall 
stay," 
May in its progress see thy guiding hand, 
And cease the acknowledged purpose to withstand ; 
Or, swept in anger from the insulted shore, 
Sink with his servile bands, to rise no more ! 
To-night, my Friend, within this humble cot 
Be scorn and fear and hope alike forgot 
In timely sleep ; and when, at break of day, 
On the tall peaks the glistening sunbeams play, 
With a light heart our course we may renew, 
The first whose footsteps print the mountain dew.

LINES 
Left upon a Seat in a Yew-tree, which stands near the 
lake of Esthwaite, on a desolate part of the shore, com- 
manding a beautiful prospect. 
Nay, Traveller ! rest. This lonely Yew-tree stands 
Far from all human dwelling : what if here 
No sparkling rivulet spread the verdant herb ? 
What if the bee love not these barren boughs ? 
Yet, if the wind breathe soft, the curling waves, 
That break against the shore, shall lull thy mind 
By one soft impulse saved from vacancy. 
Who he was 

That piled these stones and with the mossy sod 
First covered, and here taught this aged Tree 
With its dark arms to form a circling bower, 
I well remember. — He was one who owned 

DESCRIPTIVE SKETCHES, &c. 

 

No common soul. In youth by science nursed, 
And led by nature into a wild scene 
Of lofty hopes, he to the world went forth 
A favoured Being, knowing no desire 
Which genius did not hallow ; 'gainst the taint 
Of dissolute tongues, and jealousy, and hate, 
And scorn, — against all enemies prepared, 
All but neglect. The world, for so it thought, 
Owed him no service ; wherefore he at once 
With indignation turned himself away, 
And with the food of pride sustained his soul 
In solitude. — Stranger ! these gloomy boughs 
Had charms for him ; and here he loved to sit, 
His only visitants a straggling sheep, 
The stone-chat, or the glancing sand-piper : 
And on these barren rocks, with fern and heath, 
And juniper and thistle, sprinkled o'er, 
Fixing his downcast eye, he many an hour 
A morbid pleasure nourished, tracing here 
An emblem of his own unfruitful life : 
And, lifting up his head, he then would gaze 
On the more distant scene, — how lovely 'tis 
Thou seest, — and he would gaze till it became 
Far lovelier, and his heart could not sustain 
The beauty, still more beauteous ! Nor, that tune, 
When nature had subdued him to herself, 
Would he forget those Beings to whose minds 
Warm from the labours of benevolence 
The world, and human life, appeared a scene 
Of kindred loveliness : then he would sigh, 
Inly disturbed, to think that others felt 
What he must never feel : and so, lost Man ! 
On visionary views would fancy feed, 
Till his eye streamed with tears. In this deep vale 
He died, — this seat his only monument. 
If Thou be one whose heart the holy forms 
Of young imagination have kept pure, 
Stranger ! henceforth be warned ; and know that 
pride, 
Howe'er disguised in its own majesty, 
Is littleness ; that he who feels contempt 
For any living thing, hath faculties 
Which he has never used ; that thought with him 
Is in its infancy. The man whose eye 
Is ever on himself doth look on one, 
The least of Nature's works, one who might move 
The wise man to that scorn which wisdom holds 
Unlawful, ever. be wiser, Thou ! 
Instructed that true knowledge leads to love ; 
True dignity abides with him alone 
Who, in the silent hour of inward thought, 
Can still suspect, and still revere himself, 
In lowliness of heart. l . 

VIII. 
GUILT AND SORROW ; 
OR, 
INCIDENTS UPON SALISBURY PLAIN. 

ADVERTISEMENT, 
i'KEFLXED TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS POEM, PUBLISHED 
IN . 

Not less than one-third of the following poem, though it 
has from time to time been altered in the expression, was 
published so far back as the year , under the title of 
" The Female Vagrant." The extract is of such length that 
an apology seems to be required for reprinting it here : but 
it was necessary to restore it to its original position, or the 
rest would have been unintelligible. The whole was writ- 
ten before the close of the year , and I will detail, 
rather as matter of literary biography than for any other 
reason, the circumstances under which it was produced. 
During the latter part of the summer of J , having 
passed a month in the Isle of Wight, in view of the fleet 
which was then preparing for sea off Portsmouth at the 
commencement of the war, I left the place with melan- 
choly forebodings. The American war was still fresh in 
memory. The struggle which was beginning, and which 
many thought would be brought to a speedy close by the 
irresistible arms of Great Britain being added to those of 
the allies, I was assured in my own mind would be of long 
continuance, and productive of distress and misery beyond 
all possible calculation. This conviction was pressed upon 
me by having been a witness, during a long residence in 
revolutionary France, of the spirit which prevailed in that 
country. After leaving the Isle of Wight, I spent two 
days in wandering on foot over Salisbury Plain, which, 
though cultivation was then widely spread through parts 
of it, had upon the whole a still more impressive appear- 
ance than it now retains. 
The monuments and traces of antiquity, scattered in 
abundance over that region, led me unavoidably to com- 
pare what we know or guess of those remote times with 
certain aspects of modern society, and with calamities, 
principally those consequent upon war, to which, more 
than other classes of men, the poor are subject. In those 
reflections, joined with particular facts that had come to 
my knowledge, the following stanzas originated. 
In conclusion, to obviate some distraction in the minds 
of those who are well acquainted with Salisbury Plain, it 
may be proper to say, that of the features described as 
belonging to it, one or two are taken from other desolate 
parts of England. 

A Traveller on the skirt of Sarum's Plain 
Pursued his vagrant way, with feet half bare ; 
Stooping his gait, but not as if to gain 
Help from the staff he bore ; for mien and air 
Were hardy, though his cheek seemed worn with 
care 
Both of the time to come, and time long fled : 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Down fell in straggling locks his thin grey hair ; 
A coat he wore of military red 
But faded, and stuck o'er with many a patch and 
shred. 
ir. 
While thus he journeyed, step by step led on, 
He saw and passed a stately inn, full sure 
That welcome in such house for him was none. 
No board inscribed the needy to allure 
Hung there, no bush proclaimed to old and poor 
And desolate, " Here you will find a friend ! " 
The pendent grapes glittered above the door ; — 
On he must pace, perchance 'till night descend, 
Where'er the dreary roads their bare white lines 
extend. 
ut. 
The gathering clouds grew red with stormy fire, 
In streaks diverging wide and mounting high ; 
That inn he long had passed ; the distant spire, 
Which oft as he looked back had fixed his eye, 
Was lost, though still he looked, in the blank sky. 
Perplexed and comfortless he gazed around, 
And scarce could any trace of man descry, 
Save cornfields stretched and stretching without 
bound ; 
But where the sower dwelt was nowhere to be 
found. 
IV. 
No tree was there, no meadow's pleasant green, 
No brook to wet his lip or soothe his ear ; 
Long files of corn-stacks here and there were seen, 
But not one dwelling-place his heart to cheer. 
Some labourer, thought he, may perchance be near ; 
And so he sent a feeble shout — in vain ; 
No voice made answer, he could only hear 
Winds rustling over plots of unripe grain, 
Or whistling thro' thin grass along the unfurrowed 
plain. 
v. 
Long had he fancied each successive slope 
Concealed some cottage, whither he might turn 
And rest ; but now along heaven's darkening cope 
The crows rushed by in eddies, homeward borne. 
Thus warned he sought some shepherd's spreading 
thorn 
Or hovel from the storm to shield his head, 
But sought in vain ; for now, all wild, forlorn, 
And vacant, a huge waste around him spread ; 
The wet cold ground, he feared, must be his only 
bed. 
VI. 
And be it so — for to the chill night shower 
And the sharp wind his head he oft hath bared ; 

A Sailor he, who many a wretched hour 
Hath told ; for, landing after labour hard, 
Full long endured in hope of just reward, 
He to an armed fleet was forced away 
By seamen, who perhaps themselves had shared 
Like fate ; was hurried off, a helpless prey, 
'Gainst all that in Ms heart, or theirs perhaps, said 
nay. 
VII. 
For years the work of carnage did not cease, 
And death's dire aspect daily he surveyed, 
Death's minister ; then came his glad release, 
And hope returned, and pleasure fondly made 
Her dwelling in his dreams. By Fancy's aid 
The happy husband flies, his arms to throw 
Round his wife's neck ; the prize of victory laid 
In her full lap, he sees such sweet tears flow 
As if thenceforth nor pain nor trouble she could 
know. 

Vain hope ! for fraud took all that he had earned. 
The lion roars and gluts his tawny brood 
Even in the desert's heart ; but he, returned, 
Bears not to those he loves their needful food. 
His home approaching, but in such a mood 
That from his sight his children might have run, 
He met a traveller, robbed him, shed his blood ; 
And when the miserable work was done 
He fled, a vagrant since, the murderer's fate to 
shun. 

From that day forth no place to him could be 
So lonely, but that thence might come a pang 
Brought from without to inward misery. 
Now, as he plodded on, with sullen clang 
A sound of chains along the desert rang ; 
He looked, and saw upon a gibbet high 
A human body that in irons swang, 
Uplifted by the tempest whirling by ; 
And, hovering, round it often did a raven fly. 

It was a spectacle which none might view, 
In spot so savage, but with shuddering pain ; 
Nor only did for him at once renew 
All he had feared from man, but roused a train 
Of the mind's phantoms, horrible as vain. 
The stones, as if to cover him from day, 
Rolled at his back along the living plain ; 
He fell, and without sense or motion lay ; 
But, when the trance was gone, feebly pursued his 
way. 

GUILT AND SORROW. 

 

As one whose brain habitual phrensy fires 
Owes to the fit in which his soul hath tossed 
Profounder quiet, when the fit retires, 
Even so the dire phantasma which had crossed 
His sense, in sudden vacancy quite lost, 
Left his mind stiU as a deep evening stream. 
Nor, if accosted now, in thought engrossed, 
Moody, or inly troubled, would he seem 
To traveller who might talk of any casual theme. 
XII. 
Hurtle the clouds in deeper darkness piled, 
Gone is the raven timely rest to seek ; 
He seemed the only creature in the wild 
On whom the elements their rage might wreak ; 
Save that the bustard, of those regions bleak 
Shy tenant, seeing by the uncertain light 
A man there wandering, gave a mournful shriek, 
And half upon the ground, with strange affright, 
Forced hard against the wind a thick unwieldy 
flight. 
XIII. 
All, all was cheerless to the horizon's bound ; 
The weary eye — which, wheresoe'er it strays, 
Marks nothing but the red sun's setting round, 
Or on the earth strange lines, in former days 
Left by gigantic arms — at length surveys 
What seems an antique castle spreading wide ; 
Hoary and naked are its walls, and raise 
Their brow sublime : in shelter there to bide 
He turned, while rain poured down smoking on 
every side. 
XIV. 
Pile of Stone-henge ! so proud to hint yet keep 
Thy secrets, thou that lov'st to stand and hear 
The Plain resounding to the whirlwind's sweep, 
Inmate of lonesome Nature's endless year ; 
Even if thou saw'st the giant wicker rear 
For sacrifice its throngs of living men, 
Before thy face did ever wretch appear, 
Who in his heart had groaned with deadlier pain 
Than he who, tempest-driven, thy shelter now 
would gain. 
XV. 
Within that fabric of mysterious form, 
Winds met in conflict, each by turns supreme ; 
And, from the perilous ground dislodged, through 
storm 
And rain he wildered on, no moon to stream 
From gulf of parting clouds one friendly beam, 
Nor any friendly sound his footsteps led ; 
Once did the lightning's faint disastrous gleam 

Disclose a naked guide-post's double head, 
Sight which tho' lost at once a gleam of pleasure 
shed. 
XVI. 
No swinging sign-board creaked from cottage elm 
To stay his steps with faintness overcome ; 
'Twas dark and void as ocean's watery realm 
Roaring with storms beneath night's starless gloom ; 
No gipsy cower'd o'er fire of furze or broom ; 
No labourer watched his red kiln glaring bright, 
Nor taper glimmered dim from sick man's room ; 
Along the waste no line of mournful light 
From lamp of lonely toll-gate streamed athwart 
the night. 
XVII. 
At length, though hid in clouds, the moon arose ; 
The downs were visible — and now revealed 
A structure stands, which two bare slopes enclose. 
It was a spot, where, ancient vows fulfilled, 
Kind pious hands did to the Virgin build 
A lonely Spital, the belated swain 
From the night terrors of that waste to shield : 
But there no human being could remain, 
And now the walls are named the " Dead House " 
of the plain. 
XVIII. 
Though he had little cause to love the abode 
Of man, or covet sight of mortal face, 
Yet when faint beams of light that ruin showed, 
How glad he was at length to find some trace 
Of human shelter in that dreary place. 
Till to his flock the early shepherd goes, 
Here shall much-needed sleep his frame embrace. 
In a dry nook where fern the floor bestrows 
He lays his stiffened limbs, — his eyes begin to close ; 

When hearing a deep sigh, that seemed to come 
From one who mourned in sleep, he raised his 
head, 
And saw a woman in the naked room 
Outstretched, and turning on a restless bed : 
The moon a wan dead light around her shed. 
He waked her — spake in tone that would not fail, 
He hoped, to calm her mind ; but ill he sped, 
For of that ruin she had heard a tale 
Which now with freezing thoughts did all her 
powers assail ; 
XX. 
Had heard of one who, forced from storms to 
shroud, 
Felt the loose walls of this decayed Retreat 

 

'OEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Rock to incessant neighings shrill and loud, 
While his horse pawed the floor with furious heat ; 
Till on a stone, that sparkled to his feet, 
Struck, and still struck again, the troubled horse : 
The man half raised the stone with pain and sweat, 
Half raised, for well his arm might lose its force 
Disclosing the grim head of a late murdered corse. 

Such tale of this lone mansion she had learned 
And, when that shape, with eyes in sleep half 
drowned, 
By the moon's sullen lamp she first discerned, 
Cold stony horror all her senses bound. 
Her he addressed in words of cheering sound ; 
Recovering heart, like answer did she make ; 
And well it was that, of the corse there found, 
In converse that ensued she nothing spake ; 
She knew not what dire pangs in him such tale 
could wake. 
XXII. 
But soon his voice and words of kind intent 
Banished that dismal thought ; and now the wind 
In fainter howlings told its rage was spent : 
Meanwhile discourse ensued of various kind, 
Which by degrees a confidence of mind 
And mutual interest failed not to create. 
And, to a natural sympathy resigned, 
In that forsaken building where they sate 
The Woman thus retraced her own untoward fate. 

" By Derwent's side my father dwelt — a man 
Of virtuous life, by pious parents bred ; 
And I believe that, soon as I began 
To lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed, 
And in his hearing there my prayers I said : 
And afterwards, by my good father taught, 
I read, and loved the books in which I read ; 
For books in every neighbouring house I sought, 
And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought. 

A little croft we owned — a plot of corn, 
A garden stored with peas, and mint, and thyme, 
And flowers for posies, oft on Sunday morn 
Plucked while the church bells rang their earliest 
chime. 
Can I forget our freaks at shearing time ! ' 
My hen's rich nest through long grass scarce espied; 
The cowslip-gathering in June's dewy prime ; 
The swans that with white chests upreared in pride 
Rushing and racing came to meet me at the water- 
side ! 


The staff I well remember which upbore 
The bending body of my active sire ; 
His seat beneath the honied sycamore 
Where the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire ; 
When market-morning came, the neat attire 
With which, though bent on haste, myself I decked ; 
Our watchful house-dog, that would tease and tire 
The stranger till its barking-fit I checked ; 
The red-breast, known for years, which at my 
casement pecked. 

The suns of twenty summers danced along, — 
Too little marked how fast they rolled away : 
But, through severe mischance and cruel wrong, 
My father's substance fell into decay : 
We toiled and struggled, hoping for a day 
When Fortune might put on a kinder look ; 
But vain were wishes, efforts vain as they ; 
He from his old hereditary nook 
Must part ; the summons came ; — our final leave 
we took. 
XXVII. 
It was indeed a miserable hour 
When, from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed, 
Peering above the trees, the steeple tower 
That on his marriage day sweet music made ! 
Till then, he hoped his bones might there be laid 
Close by my mother in their native bowers : 
Bidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed ; — 
I could not pray : — through tears that fell in 
showers 
Glimmered our dear-loved home, alas ! no longer 
ours ! 
xxvin. 
There was a Youth whom I had loved so long, 
That when I loved him not I cannot say : 
'Mid the green mountains many a thoughtless song 
We two had sung, like gladsome birds in May ; 
When we began to tire of childish play, 
We seemed still more and more to prize each other; 
We talked of marriage and our marriage day ; 
And I in truth did love him like a brother, 
For never could I hope to meet with such another. 

Two years were passed since to a distant town 
He had repaired to ply a gainful trade : 
What tears of bitter grief, till then unknown ! 
What tender vows our last sad kiss delayed ! 
To him we turned : — we had no other aid : 
Like one revived, upon his neck I wept ; 

GUILT AND SORROW. 

 

And her whom he had loved in joy, he said, 
He well could love in grief ; his faith he kept ; 
And in a quiet home once more my father slept. 

We lived in peace and comfort ; and were blest 
With daily bread, by constant toil supplied. 
Three lovely babes had lain upon my breast : 
And often, viewing their sweet smiles, I sighed, 
And knew not why. My happy father died, 
When threatened war reduced the children's meal : 
Thrice happy ! that for him the grave could hide 
The empty loom, cold hearth, and silent wheel, 
And tears that flowed for ills which patience might 
not heal. 
xxxr. 
'Twas a hard change ; an evil time was come ; 
We had no hope, and no relief could gain : 
But soon, with proud parade, the noisy drum 
Beat round to clear the streets of want and pain. 
My husband's arms now only served to strain 
Me and his children hungering in his view ; 
In such dismay my prayers and tears were vain : 
To join those miserable men he flew, 
And now to the sea-coast, with numbers more, we 
drew. 


There were we long neglected, and we bore 
Much sorrow ere the fleet its anchor weighed ; 
Green fields before us, and our native shore, 
We breathed a pestilential air, that made 
Ravage for which no knell was heard. We prayed 
For our departure ; wished and wished — nor knew, 
'Mid that long sickness and those hopes delayed, 
That happier days we never more must view. 
The parting signal streamed — at last the land with- 
drew. 
xxxnr. 
But the calm summer season now was past. 
On as we drove, the equinoctial deep 
Ran mountains high before the howling blast, 
And many perished in the whirlwind's sweep. 
We gazed with terror on their gloomy sleep, 
Untaught that soon such anguish must ensue, 
Our hopes such harvest of affliction reap, 
That we the mercy of the waves should rue : 
We reached the western world, a poor devoted 
crew. 
XXXIV. 
The pains and plagues that on our heads came 
down, 
Disease and famine, agony and fear, 

In wood or wilderness, in camp or town, 
It would unman the firmest heart to hear. 
All perished — all in one remorseless year, 
Husband and children ! one by one, by sword 
And ravenous plague, all perished : every tear 
Dried up, despairing, desolate, on board 
A British ship I waked, as from a trance restored." 

Here paused she of all present thought forlorn, 
Nor voice, nor sound, that moment's pain expressed, 
Yet Nature, with excess of grief o'erborne, 
From her full eyes their watery load released. 
He too was mute ; and, ere her weeping ceased, 
He rose, and to the ruin's pBrtal went, 
And saw the dawn opening the silvery east 
With rays of promise, north and southward sent ; 
And soon with crimson fire kindled the firmament. 

" come," he cried, " come, after weary night 
Of such rough storm, this happy change to view." 
So forth she came, and eastward looked ; the sight 
Over her brow like dawn of gladness threw ; 
Upon her cheek, to which its youthful hue 
Seemed to return, dried the last lingering tear, 
And from her grateful heart a fresh one drew : 
The whilst her comrade to her pensive cheer 
Tempered fit words of hope ; and the lark warbled 

They looked and saw a lengthening road, and wain 
That rang down a bare slope not far remote : 
The barrows glistered bright with drops of rain, 
Whistled the waggoner with merry note, 
The cock far off sounded his clarion throat ; 
But town, or farm, or hamlet, none they viewed, 
Only were told there stood a lonely cot 
A long mile thence. While thither they pursued 
Their way, the Woman thus her mournful tale 
renewed. 

xxxvnr. 
 Peaceful as this immeasurable plain 
Is now, by beams of dawning light imprest, 
In the calm sunshine slept the glittering main ; 
The very ocean hath its hour of rest. 
I too forgot the heavings of my breast. 
How quiet 'round me ship and ocean were ! 
As quiet all within me. I was blest, 
And looked, and fed upon the silent air 
Until it seemed to bring a joy to my despair,

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

XXXIX, 
All ! how unlike those late terrific sleeps, 
And groans that rage of racking famine spoke ; 
The unburied dead that lay in festering heaps, 
The breathing pestilence that rose like smoke, 
The shriek that from the distant battle broke, 
The mine's dire earthquake, and the pallid host 
Driven by the bomb's incessant thunder-stroke 
To loathsome vaults, where heart-sick anguish 
tossed, 
Hope died, and fear itself in agony was lost ! 

Some mighty gulf of separation past, 
I seemed transported^ another world ; 
A thought resigned with pain, when from the 
mast 
The impatient mariner the sail unfurled, 
And, whistling, called the wind that hardly curled 
The silent sea. From the sweet thoughts of home 
And from all hope I was for ever hurled. 
For me — farthest from earthly port to roam 
Was best, could I but shun the spot where man 
might come. 
XLI. 
And oft I thought (my fancy was so strong) 
That I, at last, a resting-place had found ; 
' Here will I dwell,' said I, ' my whole life long, 
Roaming the illimitable waters round ; 
Here will I live, of all but heaven disowned, 
And end my days upon the peaceful flood.' — 
To break my dream the vessel reached its bound ; 
And homeless near a thousand homes I stood, 
And near a thousand tables pined and wanted 
food. 
xur. 
No help I sought; in sorrow turned adrift, 
Was hopeless, as if cast on some bare rock ; 
Nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift, 
Nor raised my hand at any door to knock. 
I lay where, with his drowsy mates, the cock 
From the cross-timber of an out-house hung : 
Dismally tolled, that night, the city clock ! 
At morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung, 
Nor to the beggar's language could I fit my 
tongue. 

So passed a second day ; and, when the third 
Was come, I tried in vain the crowd's resort. 
— In deep despair, by frightful wishes stirred, 
Near the sea-side I reached a ruined fort ; 
There, pains which nature could no more support, 

With blindness linked, did on my vitals fail ; 
And, after many interruptions short 
Of hideous sense, I sank, nor step could crawl : 
Unsought for was the help that did my life recal. 

Borne to a hospital, I lay with brain 
Drowsy and weak, and shattered memory ; 
I heard my neighbours in their beds complain 
Of many things which never troubled me — 
Of feet still bustling round with busy glee, 
Of looks where common kindness had no part, 
Of service done with cold formality, 
Fretting the fever round the languid heart, 
And groans which, as they said, might make a dead 
man start. 
XLV. 
These things just served to stir the slumbering 
sense, 
Nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised. 
With strength did memory return ; and, thence 
Dismissed, again on open day I gazed, 
At houses, men, and common light, amazed. 
The lanes I sought, and, as the sun retired, 
Came where beneath the trees a faggot blazed; 
The travellers saw me weep, my fate inquired, 
And gave me food — and rest, more welcome, more 
desired. 
XL VI. 
Rough potters seemed they, trading soberly 
With panniered asses driven from door to door ; 
But life of happier sort set forth to me, 
And other joys my fancy to allure — 
The bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor 
In barn uplighted ; and companions boon, 
Well met from far with revelry secure 
Among the forest glades, while jocund June 
Rolled fast along the sky his warm and genial 
moon. 
XLVir. 
But ill they suited me — those journeys dark 
O'er moor and mountain, midnight theft to hatch ! 
To charm the surly house-dog's faithful bark, 
Or hang on tip-toe at the lifted latch. 
The gloomy lantern, and the dim blue match, 
The black disguise, the warning whistle shrill, 
And ear still busy on its nightly watch, 
Were not for me, brought up in nothing ill : 
Besides, on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brood- 
ing still. 
xlvhi. 
What could I do, unaided and unblest ? 
My father ! gone was every friend of thine : 

GUILT AND SORROW. 

• 

And kindred of dead husband are at best 
Small help ; and, after marriage such as mine, 
With little kindness would to me incline. 
Nor was I then for toil or service fit ; 
My deep-drawn sighs no effort could confine ; 
In open air forgetful would I sit 
Whole hours, with idle arms in moping sorrow 
knit. 
XLIX. 
The roads I paced, I loitered through the fields ; 
Contentedly, yet sometimes self-accused, 
Trusted my life to what chance bounty yields, 
Now coldly given, now utterly refused. 
The ground I for my bed have often used : 
But what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth, 
Is that I have my inner self abused, 
Foregone the home delight of constant truth, 
And clear and open soul, so prized in fearless 
youth. 
L. 
Through tears the rising sun I oft have viewed, 
Through tears have seen him towards that world 
descend 
Where my poor heart lost all its fortitude : 
Three years a wanderer now my course I bend — 
Oh ! tell me whither— for no earthly friend 
Have I." — She ceased, and weeping turned away ; 
As if because her tale was at an end, 
She wept ; because she had no more to say 
Of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay. 

True sympathy the Sailor's looks expressed, 
His looks — for pondering he was mute the while. 
Of social Order's care for wretchedness, 
Of Time's sure help to calm and reconcile, 
Joy's second spring and Hope's long-treasured 
smile, 
'Twas not for Mm to speak— a man so tried. 
Yet, to relieve her heart, in friendly style 
Proverbial words of comfort he applied, 
And not in vain, while they went pacing side by 
side. 
LII. 
Ere long, from heaps of turf, before their sight, 
Together smoking in the sun's slant beam, 
Rise various wreaths that into one unite 
Which high and higher mounts with silver gleam : 
Fair spectacle, — brt instantly a scream 
Thence bursting shrill did all remark prevent ; 
They paused, and heard a hoarser voice blaspheme, 
And female cries. Their course they thither bent, 
And met a man who foamed with anger vehement. 

A woman stood with quivering lips and pale, 
And, pointing to a little child that lay 
Stretched on the ground, began a piteous tale ; 
How in a simple freak of thoughtless play 
He had provoked his father, who straightway, 
As if each blow were deadlier than the last, 
Struck the poor innocent. Pallid with dismay 
The Soldier's Widow heard and stood aghast ; 
And stern looks on the man her grey-haired Com- 
rade cast. 

His voice with indignation rising high 
Such further deed in manhood's name forbade ; 
The peasant, wild in passion, made reply 
With bitter insult and revilings sad ; 
Asked him in scorn what busmess there he had ; 
What kind of plunder he was hunting now ; 
The gallows would one day of him be glad ; — 
Though inward anguish damped the Sailor's brow, 
Yet calm he seemed as thoughts so poignant would 
allow. 

Softly he stroked the child, who lay outstretched 
With face to earth ; and, as the boy turned round 
His battered head, a groan the Sailor fetched 
As if he saw — there and upon that ground — 
Strange repetition of the deadly wound 
He had himself inflicted. Through his brain 
At once the griding iron passage found ; 
Deluge of tender thoughts then rushed amain, 
Nor could his sunken eyes the starting tear restrain. 

Within himself he said — What hearts have we ! 
The blessing this a father gives his child ! 
Yet happy thou, poor boy ! compared with me, 
Suffering not doing ill — fate far more mild. 
The stranger's looks and tears of wrath beguiled 
The father, and relenting thoughts awoke ; 
He kissed his son — so all was reconciled, 
Then, with a voice which inward trouble broke 
Ere to his lips it came, the Sailor them bespoke. 

" Bad is the world, and hard is the world's law 
Even for the man who wears the warmest fleece ; 
Much need have ye that time more closely draw 
The bond of nature, all unkindness cease, 
And that among so few there still be peace : 
Else can ye hope but with such numerous foes 
Your pains shall ever with your years increase " — 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

While from his heart the appropriate lesson flows, 
A correspondent calm stole gently o'er his woes. 

Forthwith the pair passed on ; and down they look 
Into a narrow valley's pleasant scene 
Where wreaths of vapour tracked a winding brook, 
That babbled on through groves and meadows 
green ; 
A low-roofed house peeped out the trees between ; 
The dripping groves resound with cheerful lays, 
And melancholy lowings intervene 
Of scattered herds, that in the meadow graze, 
Some amid lingering shade, some touched by the 
sun's rays. 
LEX. 
They saw and heard, and, winding with the road 
Down a thick wood, they dropt into the vale ; 
Comfort by prouder mansions unbestowed 
Their wearied frames, she hoped, would soon 
regale. 
Erelong they reached that cottage in the dale : 
It was a rustic inn ; — the board was spread, 
The milk-maid followed with her brimming pail, 
And lustily the master carved the bread, 
Kindly the housewife pressed, and they in comfort 
fed. 
LX. 
Their breakfast done, the pair, though loth, must 
part ; 
Wanderers whose course no longer now agrees. 
She rose and bade farewell ! and, while her heart 
Struggled with tears nor could its sorrow ease, 
She left him there ; for, clustering round his knees, 
With his oak-staff the cottage children played ; 
And soon she reached a spot o'erhung with trees 
And banks of ragged earth ; beneath the shade 
Across the pebbly road a little runnel strayed. 

A cart and horse beside the rivulet stood ; 
Chequering the canvas roof the sunbeams shone. 
She saw the carman bend to scoop the flood 
As the wain fronted her, — wherein lay one, 
A pale-faced Woman, in disease far gone. 
The carman wet her. lips as well behoved ; 
Bed under her lean body there was none, 
Though even to die near one she most had loved 
She could not of herself those wasted limbs have 
moved. 
LXII. 
The Soldier's Widow learned with honest pain 
And homefelt force of sympathy sincere, 

Why thus that worn-out wretch must there sustain 
The jolting road and morning air severe. 
The wain pursued its way ; and following near 
In pure compassion she her steps retraced 
Far as the cottage. " A sad sight is here," 
She cried aloud ; and forth ran out in haste 
The friends whom she had left but a few minutes 
past. 
Lxin. 
While to the door with eager speed they ran, 
From her bare straw the Woman half upraised 
Her bony visage — gaunt and deadly wan ; 
No pity asking, on the group she gazed 
With a dim eye, distracted and amazed ; 
Then sank upon her straw with feeble moan. 
Fervently cried the housewife — " God be praised, 
I have a house that I can call my own ; 
Nor shall she perish there, untended and alone !" 

So in they bear her to the chimney seat, 
And busily, though yet with fear, untie 
Her garments, and, to warm her icy feet 
And chafe her temples, careful hands apply. 
Nature reviving, with a deep-drawn sigh 
She strove, and not in vain, her head to rear ; 
Then said — " I thank you all ; if I must die, 
The God in heaven my prayers for you will hear ; 
Till now  did not think my end had been so near. 

" Barred every comfort labour could procure, 
Suffering what no endurance could assuage, 
I was compelled to seek my father's door, 
Though loth to be a burthen on his age. 
But sickness stopped me in an early stage 
Of my sad journey ; and within the wain 
They placed me — there to end life's pilgrimage, 
Unless beneath your roof I may remain : 
For I shall never see my father's door again. 

" My life, Heaven knows, hath long been burthen- 
some ; 
But, if I have not meekly suffered, meek 
May my end be ! Soon will this voice be dumb : 
Should child of mine e'er wander hither, speak 
Of me, say that the worm is on my cheek. — 
Torn from our hut, that stood beside the sea 
Near Portland lighthouse in a lonesome creek, 
My husband served in sad captivity 
On shipboard, bound till peace or death should set 
him free. 



GUILT AND SORROW. 

 

" A sailor's wife I knew a widow's cares, 
Yet two sweet little ones partook my bed ; 
Hope cheered my dreams, and to my daily prayers 
Our heavenly Father granted each day's bread ; 
Till one was found by stroke of violence dead, 
Whose body near our cottage chanced to lie ; 
A dire suspicion drove us from our shed ; 
In vain to find a friendly face we try, 
Nor could we live together those poor boys and I ; 

" For evil tongues made oath how on that day 
My husband lurked about the neighbourhood ; 
Now he had fled, and whither none could say, 
And he had done the deed in the dark wood — 
Near his own home ! — but he was mild and good ; 
Never on earth was gentler creature seen ; 
He 'd not have robbed the raven of its food. 
My husband's loving kindness stood between 
Me and all worldly harms and wrongs however 
keen." 

Alas ! the thing she told with labouring breath 
The Sailor knew too well. That wickedness 
His hand had wrought ; and when, in the hour of 
death, 
He saw his Wife's lips move his name to bless 
With her last words, unable to suppress 
His anguish, with his heart he ceased to strive ; 
And, weeping loud in this extreme distress, 
He ci'ied — " Do pity me ! That thou shouldst live 
I neither ask nor wish — forgive me, but forgive ! " 

To tell the change that Voice within her wrought 
Nature by sign or sound made no essay ; 
A sudden joy surprised expiring thought, 
And every mortal pang dissolved away. 
Borne gently to a bed, in death she lay ; 
Yet still while over her the husband bent, 
A look was in her face which seemed to say, 
" Be blest ; by sight of thee from heaven was sent 
Peace to my parting soul, the fulness of content." 

She slept in peace, — his pulses throbbed and stopped, 
Breathless he gazed upon her face, — then took 
Her hand in Ms, and raised it, but both dropped, 
When on his own he cast a rueful look. 
His ears were never silent ; sleep forsook 
His burning eyelids stretched and stiff as lead ; 
All night from time to time under him shook 
The floor as he lay shuddering on his bed ; 
And oft he groaned aloud, " God, that I were 
dead ! " 
LXXII. 
The Soldier's Widow lingered in the cot ; ' 
And, when he rose, he thanked her pious care 
Through which his Wife, to that kind shelter 
brought, 
Died in his arms ; and with those thanks a prayer 
He breathed for her, and for that merciful pair. 
The corse interred, not one hour he remained 
Beneath their roof, but to the open air 
A burthen, now with fortitude sustained, 
He bore within a breast where dreadful quiet 
reigned. 
Lxxnr. 
Confirmed of purpose, fearlessly prepared 
For act and suffering, to the city straight 
He journeyed, and forthwith his crime declared : 
" And from your doom," he added, " now I wait, 
Nor let it linger long, the murderer's fate." 
Not ineffectual was that piteous claim : 
" O welcome sentence which will end though late," 
He said, " the pangs that to my conscience came 
Out of that deed. My trust, Saviour ! is in thy 
name ! " 
LXXIV. 
His fate was pitied. Him in iron case 
(Reader, forgive the intolerable thought) 
They hung not : — no one on his form or face 
Could gaze, as on a show by idlers sought ; 
No kindred sufferer, to his death-place brought 
By lawless curiosity or chance, 
When into storm the evening sky is wrought, 
Upon his swinging corse an eye can glance, 
And drop, as he once dropped, in miserable trance.

February , . 


ACT I. 
Scene, road in a Wood. 
Wallace and Lacy. 
Lacy. The Troop will be impatient ; let us hie 
Back to our post, and strip the Scottish Foray 
Of their rich Spoil, ere they recross the Border. 
— Pity that our young Chief will have no part 
In this good service. 
Wal. Rather let us grieve 
That, in the undertaking which has caused 
His absence, he hath sought, whate'er his aim, 
Companionship with One of crooked ways, 
From whose perverted soul can come no good 
To our confiding, open-hearted, Leader. 
Lacy. True ; and, remembering how the Band 
have proved 
That Oswald finds small favour in our sight, 
Well may we wonder he has gained such power 
Over our much-loved Captain. 
Wal. I have heard 
Of some dark deed to which in early life 
His passion drove him — then a Voyager 
Upon the midland Sea. You knew his bearing 
In Palestine ? 
Lacy. Where he despised alike 
Mohammedan and Christian. But enough ; 
Let us begone — the Band may else be foiled. 
[Exeunt. 

Enter Marmaduke and Wilfred. 
Wil. Be cautious, my dear Master ! 
Mar. I perceive 
That fear is like a cloak which old men huddle 
About their love, as if to keep it warm. 
Wil. Nay, but I grieve that we should part. 
This Stranger, 
For such he is 
Mar. Your busy fancies, Wilfred, 
Might tempt me to a smile ; but what of him I 
Wil. You know that you have saved his life. 
Mar. I know it. 
Wil. And that he hates you ! — Pardon me, per- 
haps 
That word was hasty. 
Mar. Fy ! no more of it. 
Wil. Dear Master ! gratitude 's a heavy burden 
To a proud Soul. — Nobody loves this Oswald — 
Yourself, you do not love him. 
Mar. I do more, 
I honour him. Strong feelings to his heart 
Are natural ; and from no one can be learnt 
More of man's thoughts and ways than his experience 
Has given him power to teach : and then for courage 
And enterprise — what perils hath he shunned ? 
What obstacles hath he failed to overcome ? 
Answer these questions, from our common know- 
ledge, 
And be at rest. 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

Wil. Oh, Sir ! 
Mar. Peace, my good Wilfred ; 
Repair to Liddesdale, and tell the Band 
I shall be with them in two days, at farthest. 
Wil. May He whose eye is over all protect you ! 
[Exit. 
Enter Oswald (a bunch of plants in his hand). 
Osw. This wood is rich in plants and curious 
simples. 
Mar. (looking at them). The wild rose, and the 
poppy, and the nightshade : 
Which is your favorite, Oswald ? 
Osw. That which, while it is 
Strong to destroy, is also strong to heal — 
[Looking forward. 
Not yet in sight ! — We ' saunter here awhile ; 
They cannot mount the hill, by us unseen. 
Mar. (a letter in his hand). It is no common 
thing when one like you 
Performs these delicate services, and therefore 
I feel myself much bounden to you, Oswald ; 
'Tis a strange letter this ! — You saw her write it ? 
Osw. And saw the tears with which she blotted it. 
Mar. And nothing less would satisfy him ? 
Osw. No less ; 
For that another in his Child's affection 
Should hold a place, as if 'twere robbery, 
He seemed to quarrel with the very thought. 
Besides, I know not what strange prejudice 
Is rooted in his mind ; this Band of ours, 
Which you 've collected for the noblest ends, 
Along the confines of the Esk and Tweed 
To guard the Innocent — he calls us " Outlaws :" 
And, for yourself, in plain terms he asserts 
This garb was taken up that indolence 
Might want no cover, and rapacity 
Be better fed. 
Mar. Ne'er may I own the heart 
That cannot feel for one, helpless as he is. 
Osw. Thou know'st me for a Man not easily 
moved, 
Yet was I grievously provoked to think 
Of what I witnessed. 
Mar. This day will suffice 
To end her wrongs. 
Osw. But if the blind Man's tale 
Should yet be true ? 
Mar. Would it were possible ! 
Did not the Soldier tell thee that himself, 
And others who survived the wreck, beheld 
The Baron Herbert perish in the waves 
Upon the coast of Cyprus ? 
Osw. Yes, even so, 

And I had heard the like before : in sooth 
The tale of this his quondam Barony 
Is cunningly devised ; and, on the back 
Of his forlorn appearance, could not fail 
To make the proud and vain his tributaries, 
And stir the pulse of lazy charity. 
The seignories of Herbert are in Devon ; 
We, neighbours of the Esk and Tweed : 'tis much 
The Arch-impostor 
Mar. Treat him gently, Oswald ; 
Though I have never seen his face, methinks, 
There cannot come a day when I shall cease 
To love him. I remember, when a Boy 
Of scarcely seven years' growth, beneath the Elm 
That casts its shade over our village school, 
'Twas my delight to sit and hear Idonea 
Repeat her Father's terrible adventures, 
Till all the band of play -mates wept together ; 
And that was the beginning of my love. 
And, through all converse of our later years, 
An image of this old Man still was present, 
When I had been most happy. Pardon me 
If this be idly spoken. 
Osw. See, they come, 
Two Travellers ! 
Mar. {points). The woman is Idonea. 
Osw. And leading Herbert. 
Mar. We must let them pass — 
This thicket will conceal us. [They step aside. 
Enter Idonea, leading Herbert blind. 
Idon. Dear Father, you sigh deeply ; ever since 
We left the willow shade by the brook-side, 
Your natural breathing has been troubled. 
Her. Nay, 
You are too fearful ; yet must I confess, 
Our march of yesterday had better suited 
A firmer step than mine. 
Idon. That dismal Moor — 
In spite of all the larks that cheered our path, 
I never can forgive it : but how steadily 
You paced along, when the bewildering moonlight 
Mocked me with many a strange fantastic shape ! — 
I thought the Convent never would appear ; 
It seemed to move away from us : and yet, 
That you are thus the fault is mine ; for the air 
Was soft and warm, no dew lay on the grass, 
And midway on the waste ere night had fallen 
I spied a Covert walled and roofed with sods — 
A miniature ; belike some Shepherd-boy, 
Who might have found a nothing-doing hour 
Heavier than work, raised it : within that hut 
We might have made a kindly bed of heath, 
And thankfully there rested side by side 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Wrapped in our cloaks, and, with recruited strength, 
Have hailed the morning sun. But cheerily, 
Father, — 
That staff of yours, I could almost have heart 
To fling 't away from you : you make no use 
Of me, or of my strength ; — come, let me feel 
That you do press upon me. There — indeed 
You are quite exhausted. Let us rest awhile 
On this green bank. [He sits down. 
Her. {after some time). Idonea, you are silent, 
And I divine the cause. 
Idon. Do not reproach me : 
I pondered patiently your wish and will 
When I gave way to your request ; and now, 
When I behold the ruins of that face, 
Those eyeballs dark — dark beyond hope of light, 
And think that they were blasted for my sake, 
The name of Marmaduke is blown away : 
Father, I would not change that sacred feeling 
For all this world can give. 
Her. Nay, be composed : 
Few minutes gone a faintness overspread 
My frame, and I bethought me of two things 
I ne'er had heart to separate — my grave, 
And thee, my Child ! 
Idon. Believe me, honoured She ! 
'Tis weariness that breeds these gloomy fancies, 
And you mistake the cause : you hear the woods 
Resound with music, could you see the sun, 
And look upon the pleasant face of Nature 
Her. I comprehend thee — I should be as cheerful 
As if we two were twins ; two songsters bred 
In the same nest, my spring-time one with thine. 
My fancies, fancies if they be, are such 
As come, dear Child ! from a far deeper source 
Than bodily weariness. While here we sit 
I feel my strength returning. — The bequest 
Of thy kind Patroness, which to receive 
We have thus far adventured, will suffice 
To save thee from the extreme of penury ; 
But when thy Father must he down and die, 
How wilt thou stand alone ? 
Idon. Is he not strong ? 
Is he not valiant ? 
Her. Am I then so soon 
Forgotten  have my warnings passed so quickly 
Out of thy mind ? My dear, my only, Child ; 
Thou wouldst be leaning on a broken reed — 
This Marmaduke 
Idon. could you hear his voice : 
Alas ! you do not know him. He is one 
(I wot not what ill tongue has wronged him with you) 
All gentleness and love. His face bespeaks 
A deep and simple meekness : and that Soul, 

Which with the motion of a virtuous act 
Flashes a look of terror upon guilt, 
Is, after conflict, quiet as the ocean, 
By a miraculous finger, stilled at once. 
Her. Unhappy Woman ! 
Idon. Nay, it was my duty 
Thus much to speak ; but think not I forget — 
Dear Father ! how could I forget and live — 
You and the story of that doleful night 
When, Antioch blazing to her topmost towers, 
You rushed into the murderous flames, returned 
Blind as the grave, but, as you oft have told me, 
Clasping your infant Daughter to your heart. 
Her. Thy Mother too ! — scarce had I gained the 
door, 
I caught her voice ; she threw herself upon me, 
I felt thy infant brother in her arms ; 
She saw my blasted face — a tide of soldiers 
That instant rushed between us, and I heard 
Her last death- shriek, distinct among a thousand. 
Idon. Nay, Father, stop not ; let me hear it alL 
Her. Dear Daughter ! precious relic of that time — 
For my old age, it doth remain with thee 
To make it what thou wilt. Thou hast been told, 
That when, on our return from Palestine, 
I found how my domains had been usurped, 
I took thee in my arms, and we began 
Our wanderings together. Providence 
At length conducted us to Rossland, — there, 
Our melancholy story moved a Stranger 
To take thee to her home — and for myself, 
Soon after, the good Abbot of St. Cuthbert's 
Supplied my helplessness with food and raiment, 
And, as thou know'st, gave me that humble Cot 
Where now we dwell. — For many years I bore 
Thy absence, till old age and fresh infirmities 
Exacted thy return, and our reunion. 
I did not think that, during that long absence, 
My Child, forgetful of the name of Herbert, 
Had given her love to a wild Freebooter, 
Who here, upon the borders of the Tweed, 
Doth prey alike on two distracted Countries, 
Traitor to both. 
Idon. Oh, could you bear his voice ! 
I will not call on Heaven to vouch for me, 
But let this kiss speak what is in my heart. 
Enter a Peasant. 
Pea. Good morrow, Strangers ! If you want a 
Guide, 
Let me have leave to serve you ! 
Id on. My Companion 
Hath need of rest ; the sight of Hut or Hostel 
Would be most welcome. 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

Pea. Yon white hawthorn gained, 
You will look down into a dell, and there 
Will see an ash from which a sign-board hangs ; 
The house is hidden by the shade. Old Man, 
You seem worn out with travel — shall I support you? 
Her. I thank you ; but, a resting-place so near, 
'Twere wrong to trouble you. 
Pea. God speed you both. 
[Exit Peasant. 
Her. Idonea, we must part. Be not alarmed — 
'Tis but for a few days — a thought has struck me. 
Idem. That I should leave you at this house, and 
thence 
Proceed alone. It shall be so ; for strength 
Would fail you ere our journey's end be reached. 
[Exit Herbert supported by Idonea. 
Re-enter Marmaduke and Oswald. 
Mar. This instant will we stop him 
Osw. Be not hasty, 
For, sometimes, in despite of my conviction, 
He tempted me to think the Story true ; 
'Tis plain he loves the Maid, and what he said 
That savoured of aversion to thy name 
Appeared the genuine colour of his soul — 
Anxiety lest mischief should befal her 
After his death. 
Mar. I have been much deceived. 
Osiv. But sure he loves the Maiden, and never love 
Could find delight to nurse itself so strangely, 
Thus to torment her with inventions ! — death — 
There must be truth in this. 
Mar. Truth in his story ! 
He must have felt it then, known what it was, 
And in such wise to rack her gentle heart 
Had been a tenfold cruelty. 
Osw. Strange pleasures 
Do we poor mortals cater for ourselves ! 
To see him thus provoke her tenderness 
With tales of weakness and infirmity ! 
I 'd wager on his life for twenty years. 
Mar. We will not waste an hour in such a cause. 
Osw. Why, this is noble ! shake her off at once. 
Mar. Her virtues are his instruments. — A Man 
Who has so practised on the world's cold sense, 
May well deceive his Child — what ! leave her thus, 
A prey to a deceiver ? — no — no — no — 
'Tis but a word and then 
Osw. Something is here 
More than we see, or whence this strong aversion? 
Marmaduke ! I suspect unworthy tales 
Have reached his ear — you have had enemies. 
Mar. Enemies ! — of his own coinage. 
Osw. That may be, 
But wherefore slight protection such as you 

Have power to yield ? perhaps he looks elsewhere. — 
I am perplexed. 
Mar. What hast thou heard or seen ? 
Osw. No — no — the thing stands clear of mystery ; 
(As you have said) he coins himself the slander 
With which he taints her ear ; — for a plain reason ; 
He dreads the presence of a virtuous man 
Like you ; he knows your eye would search his 
heart, 
Your justice stamp upon his evil deeds 
The punishment they merit. All is plain : 
It cannot be 
Mar. What cannot be? 
Osw. Yet that a Father 
Should in his love admit no rivalship, 
And torture thus the heart of his own Child 
Mar. Nay, you abuse my friendship ! 
Osw. Heaven forbid ! — 
There was a circumstance, trifling indeed — 
It struck me at the time — yet I believe 
I never should have thought of it again 
But for the scene which we by chance have wit- 
nessed. 
Mar. What is your meaning ? 
Osw. Two days gone I saw, 
Though at a distance and he was disguised, 
Hovering round Herbert's door,a man whose figure 
Resembled much that cold voluptuary, 
The villain, Clifford. He hates you, and he knows 
Where he can stab you deepest. 
Mar. Clifford never 
Would stoop to skulk about a Cottage door — 
It could not be. 
Osvj. And yet I now remember, 
That, when your praise was warm upon my tongue, 
And the blind Man was told how you had rescued 
A maiden from the ruffian violence 
Of this same Clifford, he became impatient 
And would not hear me. 
Mar. No — it cannot be — 
I dare not trust myself with such a thought — 
Yet whence this strange aversion ? You are a man 
Not used to rash conjectures 
Osiv. If you deem it 
A thing worth further notice, we must act 
With caution, sift the matter artfully. 
[Exeunt Marmaduke and Oswald. 

Scene, the door of the Hostel. 
Herbert, Idonea, and Host. 
Her. (seated). As I am dear to you, remember, 
Child ! 
This last request. 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Idem. You know me, Sire ; farewell ! 
Her. And are you going then ? Come, come, 
Idonea, 
We must not part, — I have measured many a league 
When these old limbs had need of rest, — and now 
I will not play the sluggard. 
Idon. Nay, sit down. 
[Turning to Host. 
Good Host, such tendance as you would expect 
From your own Children, if yourself were sick, 
Let this old Man find at your hands ; poor Leader, 
[Looking at the dog. 
We soon shall meet again. If thou neglect 
This charge of thine, then ill befal thee ! — Look, 
The little fool is loth to stay behind. 
Sir Host ! by all the love you bear to courtesy, 
Take care of him, and feed the truant well. 
Host. Fear not, I will obey you ; — but One so 
young, 
And One so fair, it goes against my heart 
That you should travel unattended, Lady! — 
I have a palfrey and a groom : the lad 
Shall squire you, (would it not be better, Sir ?) 
And for less fee than I would let him run 
For any lady I have seen this twelvemonth. 
Idon. You know, Sir, I have been too long your 
guard 
Not to have learnt to laugh at little fears. 
Why, if a wolf should leap from out a thicket, 
A look of mine would send him scouring back, 
Unless I differ from the thing I am 
When you axe by my side. 
Her. Idonea, wolves 
Are not the enemies that move my fears. 
Idon. No more, I pray, of this. Three days at 
farthest 
Will bring me back — protect him, Saints — farewell ! 
[Exit Idonea. 
Host. 'Tis never drought with us — St. Cuthbert 
and his Pilgrims, 
Thanks to them, are to us a stream of comfort : 
Pity the Maiden did not wait a while ; 
She could not, Sir, have failed of company. 
Her. Now she is gone, I fain would call her back. 
Host (calling) . Holla ! 
Her. No, no, the business must be done. — 
What means this riotous noise ? 
Host. The villagers 
Are flocking in — a wedding festival — 
That 's all — God save you, Sir. 
Enter Oswald. 
Osw. Ha ! as I live, 
The Baron Herbert. 
Host. Mercy, the Baron Herbert ! 

Osw. So far into your journey ! on my life, 
You are a lusty Traveller. But how fare you ? 
Her. Well as the wreck I am permits. And 
you, Sir ? 
Osw. I do not see Idonea. 
Her. Dutiful Girl, 
She is gone before, to spare my weariness. 
But what has brought you hither \ 
Osw. A slight affair, 
That will be soon despatched. 
Her. Did Marmaduke 
Receive that letter ? 
Osw. Be at peace. — The tie 
Is broken, you will hear no more of him. 
Her. This is true comfort, thanks a thousand 
times ! — 
That noise ! — would I had gone with her as far 
As the Lord Clifford's Castle : I have heard 
That, in his milder moods, he has expressed 
Compassion for me. His influence is great 
With Henry, our good King ; — the Baron might 
Have heard my suit, and urged my plea at Court. 
No matter — he 's a dangerous Man. — That noise! — 
'Tis too disorderly for sleep or rest. 
Idonea would have fears for me, — the Convent 
Will give me quiet lodging. You have a boy, good 
Host, 
And he must lead me back. 
Osw. You are most lucky ; 
I have been waiting in the wood hard by 
For a companion — here he comes ; our journey 
Enter Marmaduke. 
Lies on your way ; accept us as your Guides. 
Her. Alas ! I creep so slowly. 
Osio. Never fear ; 
We ' not complain of that. 
Her. My limbs are stiff 
And need repose. Could you but wait au hour ? 
Osw. Most willingly ! — Come, let me lead you in, 
And, while you take your rest, think not of us ; 
We ' stroll into the wood ; lean on my arm. 
[Conducts Herbert into the house- Exit Marmaduke. 
Enter Villagers. 
Osio. (to himself coming out of the Hostel). I have 
prepared a most apt Instrument — 
The Vagrant must, no doubt, be loitering some- 
where 
About this ground ; she hath a tongue well skilled, 
By mingling natural matter of her own 
With all the daring fictions I have taught her, 
To win belief, such as my plot requires. 
[Exit Oswald. 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

Enter more Villagers, a Musician among them. 
Host (to them). Into the court, my Friend, and 
perch yourself 
Aloft upon the elm-tree. Pretty Maids, 
Garlands and flowers, and cakes and merry thoughts, 
Are here, to send the sun into the west 
More speedily than you belike would wish. 

Scene changes to the Wood adjoining the Hostel — 
Marmaduke and Oswald entering. 
Mar. I would fain hope that we deceive ourselves: 
When first I saw him sitting there, alone, 
It struck upon my heart I know not how. 
Osiv. To-day will clear up all. — You marked a 
Cottage, 
That ragged Dwelling, close beneath a rock 
By the brook-side : it is the abode of One, 
A Maiden innocent till ensnared by Clifford, 
Who soon grew weary of her ; but, alas ! 
What she had seen and suffered turned her brain. 
Cast off by her Betrayer, she dwells alone, 
Nor moves her hands to any needful work: 
She eats her food which every day the peasants 
Bring to her hut ; and so the Wretch has lived 
Ten years ; and no one ever heard her voice ; 
But every night at the first stroke of twelve 
She quits her house, and, in the neighbouring 
Churchyard 
Upon the self-same spot, in rain or storm, 
She paces out the horn.' 'twixt twelve and one — 
She paces round and round an Infant's grave, 
And in the churchyard sod her feet have worn 
A hollow ring ; they say it is knee-deep 
Ah ! what is here \ 
[A female Beggar rises up, rubbing her eyes as if in 
sleep — a Child in her arms. 
Beg. Oh ! Gentlemen, I thank you \ 
I 've had the saddest dream that ever troubled 
The heart of living creatui'e. — My poor Babe 
Was crying, as I thought, crying for bread 
When I had none to give him ; whereupon, 
I put a slip of foxglove in his hand, 
Which pleased him so, that he was hushed at once : 
When, into one of those same spotted bells 
A bee came darting, which the Child with joy 
Imprisoned there, and held it to his ear, 
And suddenly grew black, as he would die. 
Mar. We have no time for this, my babbling 
Gossip ; 
Here's what will comfort you. [Gives her money. 
Beg. The Saints reward you 
For this good deed ! — Well, Sirs, this passed away ; 

And afterwards I fancied, a strange dog, 
Trotting alone along the beaten road, 
Came to my child as by my side he slept 
And, fondling, licked his face, then on a sudden 
Snapped fierce to make a morsel of his head : 
But here he is, [hissing the Child] it must have 
been a dream. 
Osw. When next inclined to sleep, take my advice, 
And put your head, good Woman, under cover. 
Beg. Oh, sir, you would not talk thus, if you knew 
What life is this of ours, how sleep will master 
The weary-worn. — You gentlefolk have got 
Warm chambers to your wish. I 'd rather be 
A stone than what I am. — But two nights gone, 
The darkness overtook me — wind and rain 
Beat hard upon my head — and yet I saw 
A glow-worm, through the covert of the furze, 
Shine calmly as if nothing ailed the sky : 
At which I half accused the God in Heaven. — 
You must forgive me. 
Osw. Ay, and if you think 
The Fames are to blame, and you should chide 
Your favourite saint — no matter — this good day 
Has made amends. 
Beg. Thanks to you both ; but, sir ! 
How would you like to travel on whole hours 
As I have done, my eyes upon the ground, 
Expecting still, I knew not how, to find 
A piece of money glittering through the dust. 
Mar. This woman is a prater. Pray, good Lady ! 
Do you tell fortunes ? 
Beg. Oh Sir, you are like the rest. 
This Little-one — it cuts me to the heart — 
Well ! they might turn a beggar from their doors, 
But there are Mothers who can see the Babe 
Here at my breast, and ask me where I bought it: 
This they can do, and look upon my face — 
But you, Sir, should be kinder. 
Mar. Come hither, Fathers, 
And learn what nature is from this poor Wretch ! 
Beg. Ay, Sir, there's nobody that feels for us. 
Why now — but yesterday I overtook 
A blind old Greybeard and accosted him, 
I' th' name of all the Saints, and by the Mass 
He should have used me better ! — Charity ! 
If you can melt a rock, he is your man ; 
But I ' be even with him — here again 
Have I been waiting for him. 
Osw. Well, but softly, 
Who is it that hath wronged you \ 
Beg. Mark you me ; 
I'll point him out ; — a Maiden is his guide, 
Lovely as Spring's first rose ; a little dog, 
Tied by a woollen cord, moves on before 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

With look as sad as he were dumh ; the cur, 
I owe him no ill will, but in good sooth 
He does his Master credit. 
Mar. As I live, 
'Tis Herbert and no other ! 
Beg. 'Tis a feast to see him, 
Lank as a ghost and tall, his shoulders bent, 
And long beard white with age — yet evermore, 
As if he were the only Saint on earth, 
He turns his face to heaven. 
Osw. But why so violent 
Against this venerable Man ? 
Beg. I'll tell you : 
He has the very hardest heart on earth ; 
I had as lief turn to the Friar's school 
And knock for entrance, in mid holiday. 
Mar. But to your story. 
Beg. I was saying, Sir — 
Well ! — he has often spurned me like a toad, 
But yesterday was worse than all ; — at last 
I overtook him, Sirs, my Babe and I, 
And begged a little aid for charity : 
But he was snappish as a cottage cur. 
Well then, says I — I ' out with it ; at which 
I cast a look upon the Girl, and felt 
As if my heart would burst ; and so I left him. 
Osw. I think, good Woman, you are the very person 
Whom, but some few days past, I saw in Eskdale, 
At Herbert's door. 
Beg. Ay ; and if truth were known 
I have good business there. 
Osw. I met you at the threshold, 
And he seemed angry. 
Beg. Angry ! well he might ; 
And long as I can stir I ' dog him. — Yesterday, 
To serve me so, and knowing that he owes 
The best of all he has to me and mine. 
But 'tis all over now. — That good old Lady 
Has left a power of riches ; and I say it, 
If there's a lawyer in the land, the knave 
Shall give me half. 
Osw. What 's this ? — I fear, good Woman, 
You have been insolent. 
Beg. And there 's the Baron, 
I spied him skulking in his peasant's dress. 
Osw. How say you  in disguise % — 
Mar. But what's your business 
With Herbert or his Daughter ? 
Beg. Daughter ! truly — 
But how 's the day ? — I fear, my little Boy, 
We've overslept ourselves. — Sirs, have you seen 
him ? [.Offers to go. 
Mar. I must have more of this ; — you shall not 
stir 

An inch, till I am answered. Know you aught 
That doth concern this Herbert ? 
Beg, You are provoked, 
And will misuse me, Sir ! 
Mar. No trifling, Woman ! — 
Osw. You are as safe as in a sanctuary ; 
Speak. 
Mar. Speak ! 
Beg. He is a most hard-hearted Man. 
Mar. Your life is at my mercy. 
Beg. Do not harm me, 
And I will tell you all ! — You know not, Sir, 
What strong temptations press upon the Poor. 
Osw. Speak out. 
Beg. Oh Sir, I 've been a wicked Woman. 
Osw. Nay, but speak out ! 
Beg. He flattered me, and said 
What harvest it would bring us both ; and so, 
I parted with the Child. 
Mar. Parted with whom  
Beg. Idonea, as he calls her ; but the Girl 
Is mine. 
Mar. Yours, Woman ! are you Herbert's wife ? 
Beg. Wife, Sir ! his wife — not I ; my husband, 
Sir, 
Was of Kirkoswald — many a snowy winter 
We 've weathered out together. My poor Gilfred ! 
He has been two years in his grave. 
Mar. Enough. 
Osw. We 've solved the riddle — Miscreant ! 
Mar. Do you, 
Good Dame, repair to Liddesdale and wait 
For my return ; be sure you shall have justice. 
Osw. A lucky woman ! — go, you have done good 
service. [Aside. 
Mar. (to himself). Eternal praises on the power 
that saved her ! — 
Osw. (gives her money). Here 's for your little 
boy — and when you christen him 
I ' be his Godfather. 
Beg. Oh Sir, you are merry with me. 
In grange or farm this Hundred scarcely owns 
A dog that does not know me. — These good Folks, 
For love of God, I must not pass their doors ; 
But I ' be back with my best speed : for you — 
God bless and thank you both, my gentle Masters. 
[Exit Beggar. 
Mar. (to himself). The cruel Viper ! — Poor de- 
voted Maid, 
Now I do love thee. 
Osw. I am thunderstruck. 
Mar. Where is she — holla ! 
[Calling to the Beggar, who returns ; he looks at her 
stedfastly. 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

You are Idonea's Mother \ — 
Nay, be not terrified — it does me good 
To look upon you. 
Osw. (intermtpting). In a peasant's dress 
You saw, who was it \ 
Beg. Nay, I dare not speak ; 
He is a man, if it should come to his ears 
I never shall be heard of more. 
Osw. Lord Clifford ? 
Beg. What can I do ? believe me, gentle Sirs, 
I love her, though I dare not call her daughter. 
Osw. Lord Clifford — did you see him talk with 
Herbert ? 
Beg. Yes, to my sorrow — under the great oak 
At Herbert's door — and when he stood beside 
The blind Man — at the silent Girl he looked 
With such a look — it makes me tremble, Sir, 
To think of it. 
Osw. Enough ! you may depart. 
Mar. (to himself). Father! — to God himself we 
cannot give 
A holier name ; and, under such a mask, 
To lead a Spirit, spotless as the blessed, 
To that abhorred den of brutish vice ! — 
Oswald, the firm foundation of my life 
Is going from under me ; these strange discoveries — 
Looked at from every point of fear or hope, 
Duty, or love — involve, I feel, my ruin. 

ACT II. 

Scene, A Chamber in the Hostel — Oswald alone, 
rising from a Table on which he had been 
writing. 
Osw. They chose him for their Chief ! — what 
covert part 
He, in the preference, modest Youth, might take, 
I neither know nor care. The insult bred 
More of contempt than hatred ; both are flown ; 
That either e'er existed is my shame : 
'Twas a dull spark — a most unnatural fire 
That died the moment the air breathed upon it. 
— These fools of feeling are mere birds of winter 
That haunt some barren island of the north, 
Where, if a famishing man stretch forth his hand, 
They think it is to feed them. I have left .him 
To solitary meditation ;-— now 
For a few swelling phrases, and a flash 
Of truth, enough to dazzle and to blind, 
And he is mine for ever — here he comes. 

Enter Marmaduke. 
Mar. These ten years she has moved her lips 
all day 
And never speaks ! 
Osw. Who is it ? 
Mar. I have seen her. 
Osw. Oh ! the poor tenant of that ragged home- 
stead, 
Her whom the Monster, Clifford, drove to madness. 
Mar. I met a peasant near the spot ; he told me, 
These ten years she had sate all day alone 
Within those empty walls. 
Osw. I too have seen her ; 
Chancing to pass this way some six months gone, 
At midnight, I betook me to the Churchyard : 
The moon shone clear, the air was still, so still 
The trees were silent as the graves beneath them. 
Long did I watch, and saw her pacing round 
Upon the self-same spot, still round and round, 
Her lips for ever moving. 
Mar. At her door 
Rooted I stood ; for, looking at the woman, 
I thought I saw the skeleton of Idonea. 
Osw. But the pretended Father 
Mar. Earthly law 
Measures not crimes like his. 
Osw. We rank not, happily, 
With those who take the spirit of their rule 
From that soft class of devotees who feel 
Reverence for life so deeply, that they spare 
The verminous brood, and cherish what they spare 
While feeding on their bodies. Would that Idonea 
Were present, to the end that we might hear 
What she can urge in his defence ; she loves him. 
Mar. Yes, loves him ; 'tis a truth that multiplies 
His guilt a thousand-fold. 
Osw. 'Tis most perplexing : 
What must be done ? 
Mar, We will conduct her hither ; 
These walls shall witness it — from first to last 
He shall reveal him self. 
Osw. Happy are we, 
Who five in these disputed tracts, that own 
No law but what each man makes for himself ; 
Here justice has indeed a field of triumph. 
Mar. Let us begone and bring her hither ; — here 
The truth shall be laid open, his guilt proved 
Before her face. The rest be left to me. 
Osw. You will be firm : but though we well may 
trust 
The issue to the justice of the cause, 
Caution must not be flung aside ; remember, 
Yours is no common life. Self-stationed here. 
Upon these savage confines, we have seen you 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Stand like an isthmus 'twixt two stormy seas 
That oft have checked then' fury at your bidding. 
'Mid the deep holds of Solway's mossy waste, 
Your single virtue has transformed a Band 
Of fierce barbarians into Ministers 
Of peace and order. Aged men with tears 
Have blessed then' steps, the fatherless retire 
For shelter to their banners. But it is, 
As you must needs have deeply felt, it is 
In darkness and in tempest that we seek 
The majesty of Him who rules the world. 
Benevolence, that has not heart to use 
The wholesome ministry of pain and evil, 
Becomes at last weak and contemptible. 
Your generous qualities have won due praise, 
But vigorous Spirits look for something more 
Than Youth's spontaneous products ; and to-day 
You will not disappoint them ; and hereafter 
Mar. You are wasting words ; hear me then, 
once for all : 
You are a Man — and therefore, if compassion, 
Which to our kind is natural as life, 
Be known unto you, you will love this Woman, 
Even as I do ; but I should loathe the light, 
If I could think one weak or partial feeling 
Osw. You will forgive me 
" Mar. If I ever knew 
My heart, could penetrate its inmost core, 
'Tis at this moment. — Oswald, I have loved 
To be the friend and father of the oppressed, 
A comforter of sorrow ; — there is something 
Which looks like a transition in my soul, 
And yet it is not. — Let us lead him hither. 
Osw. Stoop for a moment ; 'tis an act of justice ; 
And where 's the triumph if the delegate 
Must fall in the execution of his office ? 
The deed is done — if you will have it so — 
Here where we stand — that tribe of vulgar wretches 
(You saw them gathering for the festival) 
Rush in — the villains seize us 
Mar. Seize ! 
Osw. Yes, they — 
Men who are little given to sift and weigh — 
Would wreak on us the passion of the moment. 
Mar. The cloud will soon disperse — farewell — 
but stay, 
Thou wilt relate the story. 
Osw. Am I neither 
To bear a part in this Man's punishment, 
Nor be its witness ? 
Mar. I had many hopes 
That were most dear to me, and some will bear 
To be transferred to thee. 
Osw. When I 'm dishonored ! 

Mar. I would preserve thee. How may this be 
done ? 
Osiv. By showing that you look beyond the instant. 
A few leagues hence we shall have open ground, 
And nowhere upon earth is place so fit 
To look upon the deed. Before we enter 
The barren Moor, hangs from a beetling rock 
The shattered Castle in which Clifford oft 
Has held infernal orgies — with the gloom, 
And very superstition of the place, 
Seasoning his wickedness. The Debauchee 
Would there perhaps have gathered the first fruits 
Of this mock Father's guilt. 
Enter Host conducting Herbert. 
Sost. The Baron Herbert 
Attends your pleasure. 
Osw. (to Host). We are ready — 
(to Herbert) Sir ! 
I hope you are refreshed. — I have just written 
A notice for your Daughter, that she may know 
What is become of you. — You ' sit down and 
sign it ; 
'Twill glad her heart to see her father's signature. 
[Gives the letter he had written. 
Her. Thanks for your care. 
[Sits down and writes. Exit Host. 
Osio. (aside to Marmaduke). Perhaps it would 
be useful 
That you too should subscribe your name. 
[Marmaduke overlooks Herbert — then writes — examines 
the letter eagerly. 
Mar. I cannot leave this paper. 
[He puts it up, agitated. 
Osw. (aside). Dastard ! Come. 
[Marmaduke goes towards Herbert and supports him — 
Marmaduke tremblingly beckons Oswald to take his 
place- 
Mar, (as he quits Herbert). There is a palsy 
in his limbs — he shakes. 
[Exeunt Oswald and Herbert — Marmaduke fol- 
lowing. 

Scene changes to a Wood — a Group of Pilgrims 
and Idonea with, them. 
First Pil. A grove of darker and more lofty 
shade 
I never saw. 
Sec. PH. The music of the birds 
Drops deadened from a roof so thick with leaves. 
Old Pil. This news ! It made my heart leap up 
with joy. 
Idon. I scarcely can believe it. 
Old Pil. Myself, I heard 
The Sheriff read, in open Court, a letter 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

Which purported it was the royal pleasure 
The Baron Herbert, who, as was supposed, 
Had taken refuge in this neighbourhood, 
Should be forthwith restored. The hearing, Lady, 
Filled my dim eyes with tears.— When I returned 
From Palestine, and brought with me a heart, 
Though rich in heavenly, poor in earthly, comfort, 
I met your Father, then a wandering Outcast : 
He had a Guide, a Shepherd's boy ; but grieved 
He was that One so young should pass his youth 
In such sad service ; and he parted with him. 
We joined our tales of wretchedness together, 
And begged our daily bread from door to door. 
 talk familiarly to you, sweet Lady ! 
For once you loved me. 
Idon. You shall back with me 
And see your Friend again. The good old Man 
Will be rejoiced to greet you. 
Old Pil. It seems but yesterday 
That a fierce storm o'ertook us, worn with travel, 
In a deep wood remote from any town. 
A cave that opened to the road presented 
A friendly shelter, and we entered in. 
Idon. And I was with you % 
Old Pil. If indeed 'twas you — 
But you were then a tottering Little-one — 
We sate us down. The sky grew dark and darker: 
I struck my flint, and built up a small fire 
With rotten boughs and leaves, such as the winds 
Of many autumns in the cave had piled. 
Meanwhile the storm fell heavy on the woods ; 
Our little fire sent forth a cheering warmth 
And we were comforted, and talked of comfort ; 
But 'twas an angry night, and o'er our heads 
The thunder rolled hi peals that would have made 
A sleeping man uneasy in his bed. 
O Lady, you have need to love your Father. 
His voice — methinks I hear it now, his voice 
When, after a broad flash that filled the cave, 
He said to me, that he had seen his Child, 
A face (no cherub's face more beautiful) 
Revealed by lustre brought with it from Heaven ; 
And it was you, dear Lady ! 
Idon. God be praised, 
That I have been his comforter till now ! 
And will be so through every change of fortune 
And every sacrifice his peace requires. — 
Let us be gone with speed, that he may hear 
These joyful tidings from no lips but mine. 
\_Exeant Idonea and Pilgrims. 


Scene, the Area of a half-ruined Castle — on one 
side the entrance to a dune/eon — Oswald and 
Marmaduke pacing backwards and forwards. 
Mar. 'Tis a wild night. 
Osw. I 'd give my cloak and bonnet 
For sight of a warm fire. 
Mar. The wind blows keen ; 
My hands are numb. 
Osw. Ha ! ha ! 'tis nipping cold. 
[Blowing his fingers. 
I long for news of our brave Comrades ; Lacy 
Would drive those Scottish Rovers to their dens 
If once they blew a horn this side the Tweed. 
Mar. I think I see a second range of Towers ; 
This castle has another Area — come, 
Let us examine it. 
Osw. 'Tis a bitter night ; 
I hope Idonea is well housed. That horseman, 
Who at full speed swept by us where the wood 
Roared in the tempest, was within an ace 
Of sending to his grave our precious Charge : 
That would have been a vile mischance. 
Mar. It would. 
Osw. Justice had been most cruelly defrauded. 
Mar. Most cruelly. 
Osw. As up the steep we clomb, 
I saw a distant fire in the north-east ; 
I took it for the blaze of Cheviot Beacon : 
With proper speed our quarters may be gamed 
To-morrow evening. 
[Looks restlessly towards the mouth of the dungeon. 
Mar. When, upon the plank, 
I had led him 'cross the torrent, his voice blessed me : 
You could not hear, for the foam beat the rocks 
With deafening noise, — the benediction fell 
Back on himself ; but changed into a curse. 
Osw. As well indeed it might. 
Mar. And this you deem 
The fittest place  
Osw. (aside). He is growing pitiful. 
Mar. (listening). What an odd moaning that is ! — 
Osw. Mighty odd 
The wind should pipe a little, while we stand 
Cooling our heels hi this way ! — I ' begin 
And count the stars. 
Mar. (still listening). That dog of his, you are sure, 
Could not come after us — he must have perished ; 
The torrent would have dashed an oak to splinters. 
You said you did not like his looks — that he 
Would trouble us ; if he were here again, 
I swear the sight of him would quail me moie 
Than twenty armies. 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Osw. How ? 
Mar. The old blind Man, 
When you had told him the mischance, was trou- 
bled 
Even to the shedding of some natural tears 
Into the torrent over which he hung, 
Listening in vain. 
Osiv. He has a tender heart ! 
[Oswald offers to go down into the dungeon. 
Mar. How now, what mean you ? 
Osiv. Truly, I was going 
To waken our stray Baron. Were there not 
A farm or dwelling-house within five leagues, 
We should deserve to wear a cap and bells, 
Three good round years, for playing the fool here 
In such a night as this. 
Mar. Stop, stop. 
Osw. Perhaps, 
You 'd better like we should descend together, 
And lie down by his side — what say you to it % 
Three of us— we should keep each other warm : 
I ' answer for it that our four-legged friend 
Shall not disturb us ; further I ' not engage ; 
Come, come, for manhood's sake ! 
Mar. These drowsy shiverings, 
This mortal stupor which is creeping over me, 
What do they mean ? were this my single body 
Opposed to armies, not a nerve would tremble : 
Why do I tremble now ? — Is not the depth 
Of this Man's crimes beyond the reach of thought ? 
And yet, in plumbing the abyss for judgment, 
Something I strike upon which turns my mind 
Back on herself, I think, again — my breast 
Concentres all the terrors of the Universe : 
I look at him and tremble like a child. 
Osw. Is it possible ? 
Mar. One thing you noticed not : 
Just as we left the glen a clap of thunder 
Burst on the mountains with hell-rousing force. 
This is a time, said he, when guilt may shudder ; 
But there 's a Providence for them who walk 
In helplessness, when innocence is with them. 
At this audacious blasphemy, I thought 
The spirit of vengeance seemed to ride the air. 
Osw. Why are you not the man you were that 
moment ? 
[He draws Marmaduke to the dungeon. 
Mar. You say he was asleep, — look at this arm, 
And tell me if 'tis fit for such a work. 
Oswald, Oswald ! [Leans upon Oswald. 
Osw. This is some sudden seizure ! 
Mar. A most strange faintness, — will you hunt 
me out 
A draught of water ? 

Osw. Nay, to see you thus 
Moves me beyond my bearing. — I will try 
To gain the torrent's brink. [Exit Oswald. 
Mar. {after a pause). It seems an age 
Since that Man left me. — No, I am not lost. 
Her. {at the mouth of the dungeon). Give me your 
hand ; where are you, Friends  and tell me 
How goes the night. 
Mar. 'Tis hard to measure time, 
In such a weary night, and such a place. 
Her. I do not hear the voice of my friend Oswald. 
Mar. A minute past, he went to fetch a draught 
Of water from the torrent. 'Tis, you ' say, 
A cheerless beverage. 
Her. How good it was in you 
To stay behind ! — Hearing at first no answer, 
I was alarmed. 
Mar. No wonder ; this is a place 
That well may put some fears into your heart. 
Her. Why so ? a roofless rock had been a com- 
fort, 
Storm-beaten and bewildered as we were ; 
And in a night like this, to lend your cloaks 
To make a bed for me ! — My Girl will weep 
When she is told of it. 
Mar. This Daughter of yours 
Is very dear to you. 
Her. Oh ! but you are young ; 
Over your head twice twenty years must roll, 
With all their natural weight of sorrow and pain, 
Ere can be known to you how much a Father 
May love his Child. 
Mar. Thank you, old Man, for this ! [Aside. 
Her. Fallen am I, and worn out, a useless Man; 
Kindly have you protected me to-night, 
And no return have I to make but prayers ; 
May you in age be blest with such a daughter ! — 
When from the Holy Land I had returned 
Sightless, and from my heritage was driven, 
A wretched Outcast — but this strain of thought 
Would lead me to talk fondly. 
Mar. Do not fear; 
Your words are precious to my ears ; go on. 
Her. You will forgive me, but my heart runs over. 
When my old Leader slipped into the flood 
And perished, what a piercing outcry you 
Sent after him. I have loved you ever since. 
You start — where are we ? 
Mar. Oh, there is no danger ; 
The cold blast struck me. 
Her. 'Twas a foolish question. 
Mar. But when you were an Outcast ? — Heaven 
is just ; 
Your piety would not miss its due reward ; 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

The little Orphan then would be your succour, 
And do good service, though she knew it not. 
Her. I turned me from the dwellings of my 
Fathers, 
Where none but those who trampled on my rights 
Seemed to remember me. To the wide world 
I bore her, in my arms ; her looks won pity ; 
She was my Raven in the wilderness, 
And brought me food. Have I not cause to love 
her ? 
Mar. Yes. 
Her. More than ever Parent loved a Child ? 
Mar. Yes, yes. 
Her. I will not murmur, merciful God ! 
I will not murmur ; blasted as I have been, 
Thou hast left me ears to hear my Daughter's voice, 
And arms to fold her to my heart. Submissively 
Thee I adore, and find my rest in faith. 
Enter Oswald. 
Osw. Herbert ! — confusion ! (aside). Here it 
is, my Friend, 
[Presents the Horn. 
A charming beverage for you to carouse, 
This bitter night. 
Her. Ha ! Oswald ! ten bright crosses 
I would have given, not many minutes gone, 
To have heard your voice. 
Osw. Your couch, I fear, good Baron, 
Has been but comfortless ; and yet that place, 
When the tempestuous wind first drove us hither, 
Felt warm as a wren's nest. You 'd better turn 
And under covert rest till break of day, 
Or till the storm abate. 
(To Marmaduke aside). He has restored you. 
No doubt you have been nobly entertained \ 
But soft ! — how came he forth \ The Night-mare 
Conscience 
Has driven him out of harbour  
Mar. ■ I believe 
You have guessed right. 
Her. The trees renew their murmur: 
Come, let us house together. 
[Oswald conducts him to the dungeon. 
Osw. (returns). Had I not 
Esteemed you worthy to conduct the affair 
To its most fit conclusion, do you think 
I would so long have struggled with my Nature, 
And smothered all that 's man in me ? — away ! — 
[Looking towards the dungeon. 
This man 's the property of him who best 
Can feel his crimes. I have resigned a privilege ; 
It now becomes my duty to resume it. 
Mar. Touch not a finger 

Osvj. What then must be done ? 
Mar. Which way soe'er I turn, I am perplexed. 
Osw. Now, on my life, I grieve for you. The 
misery 
Of doubt is insupportable. Pity, the facts 
Did not admit of stronger evidence ; 
Twelve honest men, plain men, would set us right; 
Their verdict would abolish these weak scruples. 
Mar. Weak ! I am weak — there does my tor- 
ment lie, 
Feeding itself. 
Osw. Verily, when he said 
How his old heart would leap to hear her steps, 
You thought his voice the echo of Idonea's. 
Mar. And never heard a sound so terrible. 
Osw. Perchance you think so now ? 
Mar. I cannot do it : 
Twee did I spring to grasp his withered throat, 
When such a sudden weakness fell upon me, 
I could have dropped asleep upon his breast. 
Osw. Justice — is there not thunder in the word ? 
Shall it be law to stab the petty robber 
Who aims but at our purse ; and shall this Par- 
ricide — 
Worse is he far, far worse (if foul dishonour 
Be worse than death) to that confiding Creature 
Whom he to more than filial love and duty 
Hath falsely trained — shall he fulfil his purpose ? 
But you are fallen. 
Mar. Fallen should I be indeed — 
Murder — perhaps asleep, blind, old, alone, 
Betrayed, in darkness ! Here to strike the blow — 
Away ! away ! [Flings away his sword. 
Osio. Nay, I have done with you : 
We ' lead him to the Convent. He shall live, 
And she shall love him. With unquestioned title 
He shall be seated in his Barony, 
And we too chant the praise of his good deeds. 
I now perceive we do mistake our masters, 
And most despise the men who best can teach us : 
Henceforth it shall be said that bad men only 
Are brave : Clifford is brave ; and that old Man 
Is brave. 
[Taking Marmaduke's sword and giving it to him. 
To Clifford's arms he would have led 
His Victim — haply to this desolate house. 
Mar. (advancing to the dungeon). It must be 
ended ! — 
Osw. Softly ; do not rouse him ; 
He will deny it to the last. He lies 
Within the Vault, a spear's length to the left. 
[Marmaduke descends to the dungeon. 
(Alone.) The Villains rose in mutiny to destroy me ; 
I could have quelled the CowaSrds, but this Stripling 

■ 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Must needs step in, and save my life. The look 
With which he gave the boon — I see it now ! 
The same that tempted me to loathe the gift. — 
For this old venerable Grey-beard — faith 
'Tis his own fault if he hath got a face 
Which doth play tricks with them that look on it : 
'Twas this that put it in my thoughts — that coun- 
tenance — 
His staff — his figure — Murder ! — what, of whom ? 
We kill a worn-out horse, and who but women 
Sigh at the deed ? Hew down a withered tree, 
And none look grave but dotards. He may live 
To thank me for this service. Rainbow arches, 
Highways of dreaming passion, have too long, 
Young as he is, diverted wish and hope 
From the unpretending ground we mortals tread ; — 
Then shatter the delusion, break it up 
And set him free. What follows ? I have learned 
That things will work to ends the slaves o' the world 
Do never dream of. I have been what he— 
This Boy — when he comes forth with bloody 
hands — 
Might envy, and am now, — but he shall know 
'What I am now — [ Goes and listens at the dungeon. 
Praying or parleying ? — tut ! 
Is he not eyeless ? He has been half-dead 
These fifteen years 
Enter female Beggar with two or three of her Companions. 
(Turning abruptly). Ha! speak — what Thing 
art thou ? 
(Recognises her). Heavens ! my good Friend ! 
[To her. 
Beg. Forgive me, gracious Sir ! — 
Osw. (to her companions). Begone, ye Slaves, or 
I will raise a whirlwind 
And send ye dancing to the clouds, like leaves. 
[They retire affrighted. 
Beg. Indeed we meant no harm ; we lodge 
sometimes 
In this deserted Castle — I repent me. 
[Oswald noes to the dungeon — listens— returns to 
the Beggar. 
Osw. Woman, thou hast a helpless Infant — keep 
Thy secret for its sake, or verily 
That wretched life of thine shall be the forfeit. 
Beg. I do repent me, Sir ; I fear the curse 
Of that blind Man. 'Twas not your money, sir 
Osw. Begone ! 
Beg. (going). There is some wicked deed in 
hand : [Aside. 
Would I could find the old Man and his Daughter. 
[Exit Beggar. 
Marmaduke re-enters from the dungeon. 
Osw. It is all over then ; — your foolish fears 

Are hushed to sleep, by your own act and deed, 
Made quiet as he is. 
Mar. Why came you down ? 
And when I felt your hand upon my arm 
And spake to you, why did you give no answer ? 
Feared you to waken him ? he must have been 
In a deep sleep. I whispered to him thrice. 
There are the strangest echoes in that place ! 
Osw. Tut ! let them gabble till the day of doom. 
Mar. Scarcely, by groping, had I reached the 
Spot, 
When round my wi'ist I felt a cord drawn tight, 
As if the blind Man's dog were pulling at it. 
Osw. But after that ? 
Mar. The features of Idonea 
Lurked in his face 
Osw. Psha ! Never to these eyes 
Will retribution show itself again 
With aspect so inviting. Why forbid me 
To share your triumph ? 
Mar. Yes, her very look, 
Smiling in sleep 
Osw. A pretty feat of Fancy ! 
Mar. Though but a glimpse, it sent me to my 
prayers. 
Osw. Is he alive ? 
Mar. What mean you \ who alive ? 
Osw. Herbert ! since you will have it, Baron 
Herbert ; 
He who will gain his Seignory when Idonea 
Hath become Clifford's harlot — is he living ? 
Mar. The old Man in that dungeon is alive. 
Osw. Henceforth, then, will I never in camp or 
field 
Obey you more. Your weakness, to the Band, 
Shall be proclaimed : brave Men, they all shall 
hear it. 
You a protector of humanity ! 
Avenger you of outraged innocence ! 
Mar. 'Twas dark — dark as the grave ; yet did 
I see, 
Saw him — his face turned toward me ; and I tell 
thee 
Idonea's filial countenance was there 
To baffle me — it put me to my prayers. 
Upwards I cast my eyes, and, through a crevice, 
Beheld a star twinkling above my head, 
And, by the living God, I could not do it. 
[Sinks exhausted. 
Osw. (to himself). Now may I perish if this turn 
do more 
Than make me change my course. 
(To Marmaduke.) Dear Marmaduke, 
My words were rashly spoken ; I recal them : 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

I feel my error ; shedding human blood 
Is a most serious thing. 
Mar. Not I alone, 
Thou too art deep in guilt. 
Osw. We have indeed 
Been most presumptuous. There is guilt in this, 
Else could so strong a mind have ever known 
These trepidations ? Plain it is that Heaven 
Has marked out this foul Wretch as one whose 
crimes 
Must never come before a mortal judgment-seat, 
Or be chastised by mortal instruments. 
Mar. A thought that 's worth a thousand 
worlds ! [Goes towards the dungeon. 
Osw. I grieve 
That, in my zeal, I have caused you so much pain. 
Mar. Think not of that ! 'tis over — we are safe. 
Osw. (as if to himself, yet speaking aloud). The 
truth is hideous, but how stifle it ? 
[Turning to Marmaduke. 
Give me your sword— nay, here are stones and 
fragments, 
The least of which would beat out a man's brains ; 
Or you might drive your head against that wall. 
No ! this is not the place to hear the tale : 
It should be told you pinioned in your bed, 
Or on some vast and solitary plain 
Blown to you from a trumpet. 
Mar. Why talk thus ? 
Whate'er the monster brooding in your breast 
I care not : fear I have none, and cannot fear 
[The sound of a horn is heard. 
That horn again — 'Tis some one of our Troop ; 
What do they here ? Listen ! 
Osw. What ! dogged like thieves ! 
Enter Wallace and Lacy, &c. 
Lacy. You are found at last, thanks to the 
vagrant Troop 
For not misleading us. 
Osw. (looking at Wallace). That subtle Grey- 
beard — 
I 'd rather see my father's ghost. 
Lacy (to Marmaduke). My Captain, 
We come by order of the Band. Belike 
You have not heard that Henry has at last 
Dissolved the Barons' League, and sent abroad 
His Sheriffs with fit force to reinstate 
The genuine owners of such Lands and Baronies 
As, in these long commotions, have been seized. 
His Power is this way tending. It befits us 
To stand upon our guard, and with our swords 
Defend the innocent. 
Mar. Lacy ! we look 
But at the surfaces of things ; we hear 

Of towns in flames, fields ravaged, young and old 
Driven out in troops to want and nakedness ; 
Then grasp our swords and rush upon a cure 
That flatters us, because it asks not thought : 
The deeper malady is better hid ; 
The world is poisoned at the heart. 
Lacy. What mean you ? 
Wal. (whose eye has been fixed suspiciously upon 
Oswald). Ay, what is it you mean ? 
Mar. Harkee, my Friends ; — 
[Appearing gay. 
Were there a Man who, being weak and helpless 
And most forlorn, should bribe a Mother, pressed 
By penury, to yield him up her Daughter, 
A little Infant, and instruct the Babe, 
Prattling upon his knee, to call him Father 
Lacy. Why, if his heart be tender, that offence 
I could forgive him. 
Mar. (going on,). And should he make the Child 
An instrument of falsehood, should he teach her 
To stretch her arms, and dim the gladsome light 
Of infant playfulness with piteous looks 
Of misery that was not 
Lacy. Troth, 'tis hard — 
But in a world like ours 
Mar. (changing his tone). This self-same Man — 
Even while he printed kisses on the cheek 
Of this poor Babe, and taught its innocent tongue 
To lisp the name of Father — could he look 
To the unnatural harvest of that time 
When he should give her up, a Woman grown, 
To him who bid the highest in the market 
Of foul pollution ■ 
 Lacy. The whole visible world 
Contains not such a Monster ! 
Mar. For this purpose 
Should he resolve to taint her Soul by means 
Which bathe the limbs in sweat to think of them ; 
Should he, by tales which would draw tears from iron, 
Work on her nature, and so turn compassion 
And gratitude to ministers of vice, 
And make the spotless spirit of filial love 
Prime mover in a plot to damn his Victim 
Both soul and body 
Wal. 'Tis too horrible ; 
Oswald, wnat say you to it  
Lacy. Hew him down, 
And fling him to the ravens. 
Mar. But his aspect 
It is so meek, his countenance so venerable. 
Wal. (with an appearance of mistrust). But how, 
what say you, Oswald ? 
Lacy, (at the same moment). Stab him, were it 
Before the Altar. 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Mar. What, if he were sick, 
Tottering upon the very verge of life, 
And old, and blind 
Lacy. Blind, say you ? 
Osw. {coming forward). Are we Men, 
Or own we baby Spirits ? Genuine courage 
Is not an accidental quality, 
A thing dependent for its casual birth 
On opposition and impediment. 
Wisdom, if Justice speak the word, beats down 
The giant's strength ; and, at the voice of Justice, 
Spares not the worm. The giant and the worm — 
She weighs them in one scale. The wiles of woman, 
And craft of age, seducing reason, first 
Made weakness a protection, and obscured 
The moral shapes ot tnings. His tender cries 
And helpless innocence — do they protect 
The infant lamb ? and shall the infirmities, 
Which have enabled this enormous Culprit 
To perpetrate his crimes, serve as a Sanctuary 
To cover him from punishment ? Shame !— Justice, 
Admitting no resistance, bends alike 
The feeble and the strong. She needs not here 
Her bonds and chains, which make the mighty feeble. 
— We recognise in this old Man a victim 
Prepared already for the sacrifice. 
Lacy. By heaven, his words are reason ! 
Osw. Yes, my Friends, 
His countenance is meek and venerable ; 
And, by the Mass, to see him at his prayers ! — 
I am of flesh and blood, and may I perish 
When my heart does not ache to think of it ! — 
Poor Victim ! not a virtue under heaven 
But what was made an engine to ensnare thee ; ' 
But yet I trust, Idonea, thou art safe. 
Lacy. Idonea ! 
Wal. How ! what ? your Idonea ? 
[To Marmaduke. 
Mar. Mine j 
But now no longer mine. You know Lord Clifford ; 
He is the Man to whom the Maiden — pure 
As beautiful, and gentle and benign, 
And in her ample heart loving even me — 
Was to be yielded up. 
Lacy. Now, by the head 
Of my own child, this Man must die ; my hand, 
A worthier wanting, shall itself entwine 
In his grey hairs ! — 
Mar. (to Lacy). I love the Father in thee. 
You know me, Friends ; I have a heart to feel, 
And I have felt, more than perhaps becomes me 
Or duty sanctions. 
Lacy. We will have ample justice. 
Who are we, Friends \ Do we not live on ground 

Where Souls are self-defended, free to grow 
Like mountain oaks rocked by the stormy wind. 
Mark the Almighty Wisdom, which decreed 
This monstrous crime to be laid open — here, 
Where Reason has an eye that she can use, 
And Men alone are Umpires. To the Camp 
He shall be led, and there, the Country round 
All gathered to the spot, in open day 
Shall Nature be avenged. 
Osw. 'Tis nobly thought ; 
His death will be a monument for ages. 
Mar. (to Lacy). I thank you for that hint. He 
shall be brought 
Before the Camp, and would that best and wisest 
Of every country might be present. There, 
His crime shall be proclaimed ; and for the rest 
It shall be done as Wisdom shall decide : 
Meanwhile, do you two hasten back and see 
That all is well prepared. 
Wal. We will obey you. 
(Aside). But softly ! we must look a little nearer. 
Mar. Tell where you found us. At some future 
time 
 will explain the cause. [Exeunt. 

ACT III. 

Scene, the door of the Hostel, a group of Pilgrims as 
before; Idonea and the Host among them. 
Host. Lady, you'll find your Father at the Convent 
As I have told you : He left us yesterday 
With two Companions ; one of them, as seemed, 
His most familiar Friend. (Going.) There was a 
letter 
Of which I heard them speak, but that I fancy 
Has been forgotten. 
Idon. (to Host). Farewell ! 
Host. Gentle pilgrims, 
St. Cuthbert speed you on your holy errand. 
[Exeunt Idonea and Pilgrims. 

Scene, a desolate Moor. 
Oswald (alone). 
Osw. Carry him to the Camp ! Yes, to the Camp. 
Oh, Wisdom ! a most wise resolve ! and then, 
That half a word should blow it to the winds ! 
This last device must end my work. — Methinks 
It were a pleasant pastime to construct 
A scale and table of belief — as thus — 
Two columns, one for passion, one for proof ; 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

Each rises as the other falls : and first, 
Passion a unit and against us — proof — 
Nay, we must travel in another path, 
Or we 're stuck fast for ever ;— passion, then, 
Shall be a unit for us ; proof — no, passion ! 
We'll not insult thy majesty by time, 
Person, and place — the where, the when, the how, 
And all particulars that dull brains require 
To constitute the spiritless shape of Fact, 
They bow to, calling the idol, Demonstration. 
A whipping to the Moralists who preach 
That misery is a sacred thing : for me, 
I know no cheaper engine to degrade a man, 
Nor any half so sure. This Stripling's mind 
Is shaken till the dregs float on the surface ; 
And, in the storm and anguish of the heart, 
He talks of a transition in his Soul, 
And dreams that he is happy. We dissect 
The senseless body, and why not the mind \ — 
These are strange sights — the mind of man, 
upturned, 
Is in all natures a strange spectacle ; 
In some a hideous one — hem ! shall I stop ? 
No. — Thoughts and feelings will sink deep, but then 
They have no substance. Pass but a few minutes, 
And something shall be done which Memory 
May touch, whene'er her Vassals are at work. 
Enter JVIarmaduke,/»-ow behind. 
Osw. (turning to meet Mm). But listen, for 
my peace 
Mar. Why, I believe you. 
Osw. But hear the proofs - 
Mar. Ay, prove that when two peas 
Lie snugly in a pod, the pod must then 
Be larger than the peas — prove this — 'twere matter 
Worthy the hearing. Fool was I to dream 
It ever could be otherwise ! 
Osw. Last night 
When I returned with water from the brook, 
I overheard the Villains — every word 
Like red-hot iron burnt into my heart. 
Said one, " It is agreed on. The blind Man 
Shall feign a sudden illness, and the Girl, 
Who on her journey must proceed alone, 
Under pretence of violence, be seized. 
She is," continued the detested Slave, 
u She is right willing — strange if she were not ! — 
They say, Lord Clifford is a savage man ; 
But, faith, to see him in his silken tunic, 
Fitting his low voice to the minstrel's harp, 
There's witchery in't. I never knew a maid 
That could withstand it. True," continued he, 
f When we arranged the affair, she wept a little 

(Not the less welcome to my Lord for that) 
And said, ' My Father he will have it so'. " 
Mar. I am your hearer. 
Osw. This I caught, and more 
That may not be retold to any ear. 
The obstinate bolt of a small iron door 
Detained them near the gateway of the Castle. 
By a dim lantern's light I saw that wreaths 
Of flowers were in their hands, as if designed 
For festive decoration ; and they said, 
With brutal laughter and most foul allusion, 
That they should share the banquet with their Lord 
And his new Favorite. 
Mar. Misery ! — 
Osw. I knew 
How you would be disturbed by this dire news, 
And therefore chose this solitary Moor, 
Here to impart the tale, of which, last night, 
I strove to ease my mind, when our two Comrades, 
Commissioned by the Band, burst in upon us. 
Mar. Last night, when moved to lift the avenging 
steel, 
I did believe all things were shadows — yea, 
Living or dead all things were bodiless, 
Or but the mutual mockeries of body, 
Till that same star summoned me back again. 
Now I could laugh till my ribs ached. Oh Fool ! 
To let a creed, built in the heart of things, 
Dissolve before a twinkling atom ! — Oswald, 
I could fetch lessons out of wiser schools 
Than you have entered, were it worth the pains. 
Young as I am, I might go forth a teacher, 
And you should see how deeply I could reason 
Of love in all its shapes, beginnings, ends ; 
Of moral qualities in their diverse aspects ; 
Of actions, and their laws and tendencies. 
Osw. You take it as it merits 
Mar. One a King, 
General or Cham, Sultan or Emperor, 
Strews twenty acres of good meadow-ground 
With carcases, in lineament and shape 
And substance, nothing differing from his own, 
But that they cannot stand up of themselves ; 
Another sits i' th' sun, and by the hour 
Floats kingcups in the brook — a Hero one 
We call, and scorn the other as Time's spend- 
thrift ; 
But have they not a world of common ground 
To occupy — both fools, or wise alike, 
Each in his way ? 
Osw. Troth, I begin to think so. 
Mar. Now for the corner-stone of my philosophy: 
I would not give a denier for the man 
Who, on such provocation as this earth 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Yields, could not chuck his habe beneath the chin, 
And send it with a fillip to its grave. 
Osw. Nay, you leave me behind. 
Mar. That such a One, 
So pious in demeanour ! in his look 
So saintly and so pure ! Hark'ee, my Friend, 
I ' plant myself before Lord Clifford's Castle, 
A surly mastiff kennels at the gate, 
And he shall howl and I will laugh, a medley 
Most tunable. 
Osw. In faith, a pleasant scheme ; 
But take your sword along with you, for that 
Might in such neighbourhood find seemly use. — 
But first, how wash our hands of this old Man \ 
Mar. Oh yes, that mole, that viper in the path ; 
Plague on my memory, him I had forgotten. 
Osw. You know we left him sitting — see him 
yonder. 
Mar. Ha ! ha ! — 
Osw. As 'twill be but a moment's work, 
I will stroll on ; you follow when 'tis done. 
[Exeunt. 

Scene changes to another part of the Moor at a short 
distance — Herbert is discovered seated on a stone. 
Her. A sound of laughter, too ! — 'tis well — I 
feared, 
The Stranger had some pitiable sorrow 
Pressing upon his solitary heart. 
Hush ! — 'tis the feeble and earth-loving wind 
That creeps along the bells of the crisp heather. 
Alas ! 'tis cold — I shiver in the sunshine — 
What can this mean ? There is a psalm that speaks 
Of God's parental mercies — with Idonea 
I used to sing it. — Listen !— what foot is there ? 
Enter Marmaduke. 
Mar. {aside— looking at Herbebt). And I have 
loved this Man ! and she hath loved him ! 
And I loved her, and she loves the Lord Clifford ! 
And there it ends ; — if this be not enough 
To make mankind merry for evermore, 
Then plain it is as day, that eyes were made 
For a wise purpose — verily to weep with ! 
[Looking round. 
A pretty prospect this, a masterpiece 
Of Nature, finished with most curious skill ! 
{To Herbert). Good Baron, have you ever 
practised tillage ? 
Pray tell me what this land is worth by the acre ? 
Her. How glad I am to hear your voice ! I know not 
Wherein I have offended you ; — last night 
I found in you the kindest of Protectors ; 

This morning, when I spoke of weariness, 
You from my shoulder took my scrip and threw it 
About your own ; but for these two hours past 
Once only have you spoken, when the lark 
Whirred from among the fern beneath our feet, 
And I, no coward in my better days, 
Was almost terrified. 
Mar. That 's excellent ! — 
So, you bethought you of the many ways 
In which a man may come to his end, whose crimes 
Have roused all Nature up against him — pshaw ! — 
Her. For mercy's sake, is nobody in sight ? 
No traveller, peasant, herdsman ? 
Mar. Not a soul : 
Here is a tree, ragged, and bent, and bare, 
That turns its goat's-beard flakes of pea-green moss 
From the stern breathing of the rough sea- wind ; 
This have we, but no other company : 
Commend me to the place. If a man should die 
And leave his body here, it were all one 
As he were twenty fathoms underground. 
Her. Where is our common Friend ? 
Mar. A ghost, methinks — 
The Spirit of a murdered man, for instance — 
Might have fine room to ramble about here, 
A grand domain to squeak and gibber in. 
Her. Lost Man ! if thou have any close-pent 
guilt 
Pressing upon thy heart, and this the hour 
Of visitation 
Mar. A bold word from you ! 
Her. Restore him, Heaven ! 
Mar. The desperate Wretch ! — A Flower, 
Fairest of all flowers, was she once, but now 
They have snapped her from the stem — Poll ! let 
her he 
Besoiled with mire, and let the houseless snail 
Feed on her leaves. You knew her well — ay, 
there, 
Old Man ! you were a very Lynx, you knew 
The worm was in her 
Her. Mercy ! Sir, what mean you ? 
Mar. You have a Daughter ! 
Her. Oh that she were here ! — 
She hath an eye that sinks into all hearts, 
And if I have in aught offended you, 
Soon would her gentle voice make peace between 
us. 
Mar. (aside). I do believe he weeps — I could 
weep too — 
There is a vein of her voice that runs through his : 
Even such a Man my fancy bodied forth 
From the first moment that I loved the Maid ; 
And for his sake I loved her more : these tears — 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

I did not think that aught was left in me 
Of what I have been — yes, I thank thee, Heaven ! 
One happy thought has passed across my mind.- 
— It may not be — I am cut off from man ; 
No more shall I be man — no more shall I 
Have human feelings !— {To Herbert) — Now, for 
a little more 
About your Daughter ! 
Her. Troops of armed men, 
Met in the roads, would bless us ; little children, 
Rushing along in the full tide of play, 
Stood silent as we passed them ! I have heard 
The boisterous carman, in the miry road, 
Check Ins loud whip and hail us with mild voice, 
And speak with milder voice to his poor beasts. 
Mar. And whither were you going ? 
Her. Learn, young Man, 
To fear the virtuous, and reverence misery, 
Whether too much for patience, or, like mine, 
Softened till it becomes a gift of mercy. 
Mar. Now, this is as it should be ! 
Her. I am weak ! — 
My Daughter does not know how weak I am ; 
And, as thou see'st, under the arch of heaven 
Here do I stand, alone, to helplessness, 
By the good God, our common Father, doomed ! — 
But I had once a spirit and an arm 
Mar. Now, for a word about your Barony : 
I fancy when you left the Holy Land, 
And came to — what 's your title — eh ? your claims 
Were undisputed ! 
Her. Like a mendicant, 
Whom no one comes to meet, I stood alone ; — 
I murmured — but, remembering Him who feeds 
The pelican and ostrich of the desert, 
From my own threshold I looked up to Heaven 
And did not want glimmerings of quiet hope. 
So, from the court I passed, and down the brook, 
Led by its murmur, to the ancient oak 
I came ; and when I felt its cooling shade, 
I sate me down, and cannot but believe — 
While in my lap I held my little Babe 
And clasped her to my heart, my heart that ached 
More with delight than grief — I heard a voice 
Such as by Cherith on Elijah called ; 
It said, " I will be with thee." A little boy, 
A shepherd-lad, ere yet my trance was gone, 
Hailed us as if he had been sent from heaven, 
And said, with tears, that he would be our guide : 
I had a better guide — that innocent Babe — 
Her, who hath saved me, to this hour, from harm, 
From cold, from hunger, penury, and death ; 
To whom I owe the best of all the good 
I have, or wish for, upon earth — and more 

And higher far than lies within earth's bounds : 
Therefore I bless her : when I think of Man, 
I bless her with sad spirit, — when of God, 
I bless her in the fulness of my joy ! 
Mar. The name of daughter in his mouth, he 
prays ! 
With nerves so steady, that the very flies 
Sit unmolested on his staff. — Innocent ! — 
If he were innocent — then he would tremble 
And be disturbed, as I am. [Turning aside). I 
have read 
In Story, what men now alive have witnessed, 
How, when the People's mind was racked with 
doubt, 
Appeal was made to the great Judge : the 
Accused 
With naked feet walked over burning ploughshares. 
Here is a Man by Nature's hand prepared 
For a like trial, but more merciful. 
Why else have I been led to this bleak Waste ? 
Bare is it, without house or track, and destitute 
Of obvious shelter, as a shipless sea. 
Here will I leave him — here — All-seeing God ! 
Such as he is, and sore perplexed as I am, 
I will commit him to this final Ordeal I — 
He heard a voice — a shepherd-lad came to him 
And was his guide ; if once, why not again, 
And in this desert ? If never — then the whole 
Of what he says, and looks, and does, and is, 
Makes up one damning falsehood. Leave him here 
To cold and hunger ! — Pain is of the heart, 
And what are a few throes of bodily suffering 
If they can waken one pang of remorse \ 
[Goes up to Herbert. 
Old Man ! my wrath is as a flame burnt out, 
It cannot be rekindled. Thou art here 
Led by my hand to save thee from perdition ; 
Thou wilt have time to breathe and think 
Her. Oh, Mercy ! 
Mar. I know the need that all men have of mercy, 
And therefore leave thee to a righteous judgment. 
Her. My Child, my blessed Child ! 
Mar. No more of that ; 
Thou wilt have many guides if thou art innocent ; 
Yea, from the utmost corners of the earth, 
That Woman will come o'er this Waste to save thee. 
[He pauses and looks at Herbert's staff. 
Ha ! what is here ? and carved by her own hand ! 
[Reads upon the stuff. 
" I am eyes to the blind, saith the Lord. 
He that puts his trust in me shall not fail !" 
Yes, be it so ; — repent and be forgiven — ■ 
God and that staff are now thy only guides. 
[He leaves Herbert on the Moor. 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Scene, an eminence, a Beacon on the summit. 
Lacy, Wallace, Lennox, &c. &c. 
Several of the Band {confusedly). But patience ! 
One of the Band. Curses on that Traitor, 
Oswald ! — 
Our Captain made a prey to foul device ! — 
Len. (toWal.). His tool, the wandering Beggar, 
made last night 
A plain confession, such as leaves no douht, 
Knowing what otherwise we know too well, 
That she revealed the truth. Stand by me now ; 
For rather would I have a nest of vipers 
Between my breast-plate and my skin, than make 
Oswald my special enemy, if you 
Deny me your support. 
Lacy. We have been fooled — 
But for the motive ? 
Wal. Natures such as his 
Spin motives out of their own bowels, Lacy ! 
I learn'd this when I was a Confessor. 
I know him well ; there needs no other motive 
Than that most strange incontinence in crime 
Which haunts this Oswald. Power is life to him 
And breath and being ; where he cannot govern, 
He will destroy. 
Lacy. To have been trapped like moles ! — 
Yes, you are right, we need not hunt for motives : 
There is no crime from which this man would shrink ; 
He recks not human law ; and I have noticed 
That often when the name of God is uttered, 
A sudden blankness overspreads his face. 
Len. Yet, reasoner as he is, his pride has built 
Some uncouth superstition of its own. 
Wal. I have seen traces of it. 
Len. Once he headed 
A band of Pirates in the Norway seas ; 
And when the King of Denmark summoned him 
To the oath of fealty, I well remember, 
'Twas a strange answer that he made ; he said, 
"  hold of Spirits, and the Sun in heaven." 
Lacy. He is no madman. 
Wal. A most subtle doctor 
Were that man, who could draw the line that parts 
Pride and her daughter, Cruelty, from Madness, 
That should be scourged, not pitied. Restless 
Minds, 
Such Minds as find amid their fellow-men 
No heart that loves them, none that they can love, 
Will turn perforce and seek for sympathy 
In dim relation to imagined Beings. 
One of the Band. What if he mean to offer up 
our Captain 

An expiation and a sacrifice 
To those infernal fiends ! 
Wal. Now, if the event 
Should be as Lennox has foretold, then swear, 
My Friends, his heart shall have as many wounds 
As there are daggers here. 
Lacy. What need of swearing ! 
One of the Band. Let us away ! 
Another. Away ! 
A third. Hark ! how the horns 
Of those Scotch Rovers echo through the vale. 
Lacy. Stay you behind; and when the sun is down, 
Light up this beacon. 
One of the Band. You shall be obeyed. 
[They go out together. 



Scene, the Wood on the edye of the Moor. 
Marmaduke (alone). 
Mar. Deep, deep and vast, vast beyond human 
thought, 
Yet calm. — I could believe, that there was here 
The only quiet heart on earth. In terror, 
Remembered terror, there is peace and rest. 
Enter Oswald. 
Osw. Ha ! my dear Captain. 
Mar. A later meeting, Oswald, 
Would have been better timed. 
Osw. Alone, I see ; 
You have done your duty. I had hopes, which now 
I feel that you will justify. 
Mar. I had fears, 
From which I have freed myself — but 'tis my wish 
To be alone, and therefore we must part. 
Osw. Nay, then — I am mistaken. There's a 
weakness 
About you still ; you talk of solitude — 
I am your friend. 
Mar. What need of this assurance 
At any time ? and why given now ? 
Osiv. Because 
You are now in truth my Master ; you have 
taught me 
What there is not another living man 
Had strength to teach ; — and therefore gratitude 
Is bold, and would relieve itself by praise. 
Mar. Wherefore press this on me ? 
Osw. Because I feel 
That you have shown, and by a signal instance, 
How they who would be just must seek the rule 
By diving for it into then' own bosoms. 
To-day you have thrown off a tyranny 
That lives but in the torpid acquiescence 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

Of our emasculated souls, the tyranny 
Of the world's masters, with the musty rules 
By which they uphold their craft from age to age : 
You have obeyed the only law that sense 
Submits to recognise ; the immediate law, 
From the clear tight of circumstances, flashed 
Upon an independent Intellect. 
Henceforth new prospects open on your path ; 
Your faculties should grow with the demand ; 
I still will be your friend, will cleave to you 
Through good and evil, obloquy and scorn, 
Oft as they dare to follow on your steps. 
Mar. I would be left alone. 
Osiv. (exultingly). I know your motives ! 
I am not of the world's presumptuous judges, 
Who damn where they can neither see nor feel, 
With a hard-hearted ignorance ; your struggles 
I witness'd, and now hail your victory. 
Mar. Spare me awhile that greeting. 
Osw. It may be, 
That some there are, squeamish half-thinking 
cowards, 
Who will turn pale upon you, call you murderer, 
And you will walk in solitude among them. 
A mighty evil for a strong-built mind ! — 
Join twenty tapers of unequal height 
And light them joined, and you will see the less 
How 'twill burn down the taller ; and they all 
Shall prey upon the tallest. Solitude ! — 
The Eagle lives in Solitude ! 
Mar. Even so, 
The Sparrow so on the house-top, and I, 
The weakest of God's creatures, stand resolved 
To abide the issue of my act, alone. 
Osw. Now would you ? and for ever ? — My young 
Friend, 
As time advances either we become 
The prey or masters of our own past deeds. 
Fellowship we must have, willing or no ; 
And if good Angels fail, slack in their duty, 
Substitutes, turn our faces where we may, 
Are still forthcoming ; some which, though they bear 
 names, can render no ill services, 
In recompense for what themselves required. 
So meet extremes in this mysterious world, 
And opposites thus melt into each other. 
Mar. Time, since Man first drew breath, has 
never moved 
With such a weight upon his wings as now ; 
But they will soon be lightened. 
Osw. Ay, look up — 
Cast round you your mind's eye, and you will learn 
Fortitude is the child of Enterprise : 
Great actions move our admiration, chiefly 

Because they carry in themselves an earnest 
That we can suffer greatly. 
Mar. Very true. 
Osw. Action is transitory — a step, a blow, 
The motion of a muscle — this way or that — 
'Tis done, and in the after-vacancy 
We wonder at ourselves like men betrayed : 
Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark, 
And shares the nature of infinity. 
Mar. Truth— and I feel it. 
Osw. What ! if you had bid 
Eternal farewell to unmingled joy 
And the light dancing of the thoughtless heart ; 
It is the toy of fools, and little fit 
For such a world as this. The wise abjure 
All thoughts whose idle composition lives 
In the entire forgetfulness of pain. 
— I see I have disturbed you. 
Mar. By no means. 
Osw. Compassion ! — pity !— pride can do without 
them ; 
And what if you should never know them more ! — 
He is a puny soul who, feeling pain, 
Finds ease because another feels it too. 
If e'er I open out this heart of mine 
It shall be for a nobler end — to teach 
And not to purchase puling sympathy. 
— Nay, you are pale. 
Mar. It may be so. 
Osw. Remorse — 
It cannot five with thought ; think on, think on, 
And it will die. What ! in this universe, 
Where the least things control the greatest, where 
The faintest breath that breathes can move a world ; 
What ! feel remorse, where, if a cat had sneezed, 
A leaf had fallen, the thing had never been 
Whose very shadow gnaws us to the vitals. 
Mar. Now, whither are you wandering ? That 
a man 
So used to suit his language to the time, 
Should thus so widely differ from himself — 
It is most strange. 
Osio. Murder ! — what 's in the word ! — 
I have no cases by me ready made 
To fit all deeds. Carry him to the Camp !— 
A shallow project ; — you of late have seen 
More deeply, taught us that the institutes 
Of Nature, by a cunning usurpation 
Banished from human intercourse, exist 
Only in our relations to the brutes 
That make the fields their dwelling. If a snake 
Crawl from beneath our feet we do not ask 
A license to destroy him : our good governors 
Hedge in the life of every pest and plague 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

That bears the shape of man ; and for what pur- 
pose, 
But to protect themselves from extirpation ? — ■ 
This flimsy barrier you have overleaped. 
Mar. My Office is fulfilled — the Man is now 
Delivered to the Judge of all things. 
Osio. Dead ! 
Mar. Ihavebornemy burthen to its destined end. 
Osw. This instant we ' return to our Com- 
panions — 
Oh how I long to see their faces again ! 
Enter Idonba, with Pilgrims who continue their journey. 
Idon. {after some time). What, Marmaduke ! 
now thou art mine for ever. 
And Oswald, too ! (To Marmaduke). On will we 
to my Father 
With the glad tidings which this day hath brought ; 
We ' go together, and, such proof received 
Of his own rights restored, his gratitude 
To God above will make him feel for ours. 
Osw. I interrupt you ? 
Idon. Think not so. 
Mar. Idonea, 
That I should ever live to see this moment ! 
Idon. Forgive me. — Oswald knows it all — he 
knows, 
Each word of that unhappy letter fell 
As a blood drop from my heart. 
Osw. 'Twas even so. 
Mar. I have much to say, but for whose ear ? — 
not thine. 
Idon. Ill can I bear that look — Plead for me, 
Oswald ! 
You are my Father's Friend. 
(To Marmaduke). • Alas, you know not, 
And never can you know, bow much he loved me. 
Twice had he been to me a father, twice 
Had given me breath, and was I not to be 
His daughter, once his daughter ? could I withstand 
His pleading face, and feel his clasping arms, 
And hear his prayer that I would not forsake him 
In his old age [Hides her face. 
Mar. Patience — Heaven grantme patience ! — 
She weeps, she weeps — my brain shall burn for hours 
Ere / can shed a tear. 
Idon. I was a woman ; 
And, balancing the hopes that are the dearest 
To womankind with duty to my Father, 
I yielded up those precious hopes, which nought 
On earth could else have wrested from me ; — if 
erring, 
Oh let me be forgiven ! 

Mar. I do forgive thee. 
Idon. But take me to your arms — this breast, 
alas ! 
It throbs, and you have a heart that does not feel it. 
Mar. (exultingly) . She is innocent. 
[He embraces her. 
Osw. (aside). Were I a Moralist, 
I should make wondrous revolution here ; 
It were a quaint experiment to show 
The beauty of trutb — [Addressing them. 
I see I interrupt you ; 
I shall have business with you, Marmaduke ; 
Follow me to the Hostel. [Exit Oswald. 
Idon. Marmaduke, 
This is a happy day. My Father soon 
Shall sun himself before his native doors ; 
The lame, the hungry, will be welcome there. 
No more shall he complain of wasted strength, 
Of thoughts that fail, and a decaying heart ; 
His good works will be balm and life to him. 
Mar. This is most strange ! — I know not what 
it was, 
But there was something which most plainly said, 
That thou wert innocent. 
Idon. How innocent ! — 
Oh heavens ! you 've been deceived. 
Mar. Thou art a Woman, 
To bring perdition on the universe. 
Idon. Already I 've been punished to the height 
Of my offence. [Smiling affectionately. 
I see you love me still. 
The labours of my hand are still your joy ; 
Bethink you of the hour when on your shoulder 
I hung this belt. 
[Pointing to the belt on which ivas suspended 
Herbert's scrip. 
Mar. Mercy of Heaven ! - [Sinks. 
Idon. What ails you ! [Distractedly. 
Mar. The scrip that held his food, and I forgot 
To give it back again ! 
Idon. What mean your words ? 
Mar. I know not what I said — all may be well. 
Idon. That smile hath life in it ! 
Mar. This road is perilous ; 
I will attend you to a Hut that stands 
Near the wood's edge — rest there to-night, I pray 
you : 
For me, I have business, as you heard, with Oswald, 
But will return to you by break of day. [Exeunt. 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

ACT IV. 
Scene, A desolate prospect — a ridge of rocks — a 
Chapel on the summit of one — Moon behind the 
rocks — night stormy — irregular sound of a bell — ■ 
Herbert enters exhausted. 
Her. That Chapel-bell in mercy seemed to guide me, 
But now it mocks my steps ; its fitful stroke 
Can scarcely be the work of human hands. 
Hear me, ye Men, upon the cliffs, if such 
There be who pray nightly before the Altar. 
Oh that I had but strength to reach the place ! 
My Child — my child — dark — dark — I faint — this 
wind — 
These stifling blasts — God help me ! 
Enter Eldred. 
Eld. Better this bare rock, 
Though it were tottering over a man's head, 
Than a tight case of dungeon walls for shelter 
From such rough dealing. 
[_A moaning voice is heard. 
Ha ! what sound is that  
Trees creaking in the wind (but none are here) 
Send forth such noises — and that weary bell ! 
Surely some evil Spirit abroad to-night 
Is ringing it — 'twould stop a Saint in prayer, 
And that — what is it ? never was sound so like 
A human groan. Ha ! what is here ? Poor Man — 
Murdered ! alas ! speak— speak, I am your friend : 
No answer — hush — lost wretch, he lifts his hand 
And lays it to his heart — (Kneels to him). I pray 
you speak ! 
What has befallen you ? 
Her. (feebly). A stranger has done this, 
And in the arms of a stranger I must die. 
Eld. Nay, think not so : come, let me raise 
you up : [Raises him. 
This is a dismal place — well— that is well — 
I was too fearful — take me for your guide 
And your support — my hut is not far off. 
[Draws him gently off the stage. 

Scene, a room in the Hostel — Marmaduke and 
Oswald. 
Mar. But for Idonea ! — I have cause to think 
That she is innocent. 
Osw. Leave that thought awhile, 
As one of those beliefs which in their hearts 
Lovers lock up as pearls, though oft no better 
Than feathers clinging to their points of passion. 

This day's event has laid on me the duty 
Of opening out my story ; you must hear it, 
And without further preface. — In my youth, 
Except for that abatement which is paid 
By envy as a tribute to desert, 
I was the pleasure of all hearts, the darling 
Of every tongue — as you are now. You 've heard 
That I embarked for Syria. On our voyage 
Was hatched among the crew a foul Conspiracy 
Against my honour, in the which our Captain 
Was, I believed, prime Agent. The wind fell ; 
We lay becalmed week after week, until 
The water of the vessel was exhausted ; 
I felt a double fever in my veins, 
Yet rage suppressed itself ; — to a deep stillness 
Did my pride tame my pride ; — for many days, 
On a dead sea under a burning sky, 
I brooded o'er my injuries, deserted 
By man and nature ; — if a breeze had blown, 
It might have found its way into my heart, 
And I had been — no matter — do you mark me ? 
Mar. Quick — to the point — if any untold crime 
Doth haunt your memory. 
Osw., Patience, hear me further ! — 
One day in silence did we drift at noon 
By a bare rock, narrow, and white, and bare ; 
No food was there, no drink, no grass, no shade, 
No tree, nor jutting eminence, nor form 
Inanimate large as the body of man, 
Nor any living thing whose lot of life 
Might stretch beyond the measure of one moon. 
To dig for water on the spot, the Captain 
Landed with a small troop, myself being one : 
There I reproached him with his treachery. 
Imperious at all times, his temper rose ; 
He struck me ; and that instant had I killed him, 
And put an end to his insolence, but my Comrades 
Rushed in between us : then did I insist 
(All hated him, and I was stung to madness) 
That we should leave him there, alive ! — we did so. 
Mar. And he was famished ? 
Osw. Naked was the spot ; 
Methinks I see it now — how in the sun 
Its stony surface glittered hke a shield ; 
And in that miserable place we left him, 
Alone but for a swarm of minute creatures 
Not one of which could help him while alive, 
Or mourn him dead. 
Mar. A man by men cast off, 
Left without burial ! nay, not dead nor dying, 
But standing, walking, stretching forth his arms, 
In all things hke ourselves, but in the agony 
With which he called for mercy ; and — even so — 
He was forsaken ? 

a 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Osiv, There is a power in sounds : 
The cries he uttered might have stopped the boat 
That bore us through the water 
Mar. You returned 
Upon that dismal hearing — did you not ? 
Osvj. Some scoffed at him with hellish mockery, 
And laughed so loud it seemed that the smooth sea 
Did from some distant region echo us. 
Mar. We all are of one blood, our veins are filled 
At the same poisonous fountain ! 
Osw. 'Twas an island 
Only by sufferance of the winds and waves, 
Which with their foam could cover it at will. 
I know not how he perished ; but the calm, 
The same dead calm, continued many days. 
Mar. But his own crime had brought on him 
this doom, 
His wickedness prepared it ; these expedients 
Are terrible, yet ours is not the fault. 
Osio. The man was famished, and was innocent! 
Mar. Impossible ! 
Osw. The man had never wronged me. 
Mar. Banish the thought, crush it, and be at 
peace. 
His guilt was marked — these things could never be 
Were there not eyes that see, and for good ends, 
Where ours are baffled. 
Osw. I had been deceived. 
Mar. And from that hour the miserable man 
No more was heard of ? 
Os%v. I had been betrayed. 
Mar. And he found no deliverance ! 
Osw. The Crew 
Gave me a hearty welcome ; they had laid 
The plot to rid themselves, at any cost, 
Of a tyrannic Master whom they loathed. 
So we pursued our voyage : when we landed, 
The tale was spread abroad ; my power at once 
Shrunk from me ; plans and schemes, and lofty 
hopes — 
All vanished. I gave way — do you attend ? 
Mar. The Crew deceived you ? 
Osw. Nay, command yourself. 
Mar. It is a dismal night — how the wind howls ! 
Osw. I hid my head within a Convent, there 
Lay passive as a dormouse in mid winter. 
That was no life for me — I was o'erthrown, 
But not destroyed. 
Mar. The proofs — you ought to have seen 
The guilt — have touched it — felt it at your heart — 
As I have done. 
Osw. A fresh tide of Crusaders 
Drove by the place of my retreat : three nights 
Did constant meditation dry my blood ; 

Three sleepless nights I passed in sounding on, 
Through words and things, a dim and perilous way ; 
And, wheresoe'er I turned me, I beheld 
A slavery compared to which the dungeon 
And clanking chains are perfect liberty. 
You understand me — I was comforted ; 
I saw that every possible shape of action 
Might lead to good — I saw it and burst forth 
Thirsting for some of those exploits that fill 
The earth for sure redemption of lost peace. 
[Marking Marmaduke's countenance. 
Nay, you have had the worst. Ferocity 
Subsided in a moment, like a wind 
That drops down dead out of a sky it vexed. 
And yet I had within me evermore 
A salient spring of energy ; I mounted 
From action up to action with a mind 
That never rested — without meat or drink 
Have I lived many days — my sleep was bound 
To purposes of reason — not a dream 
But had a continuity and substance 
That waking life had never power to give. 
Mar. wretched Human-kind ! — Until the 
mystery 
Of all this world is solved, well may we envy 
The worm, that, underneath a stone whose weight 
Would crush the lion's paw with mortal anguish, 
Doth lodge, and feed, and coil, and sleep, in safety. 
Fell not the wrath of Heaven upon those traitors ? 
Osw. Give not to them a thought. From Palestine 
We marched to Syria : oft I left the Camp, 
When all that multitude of hearts was still, 
And followed on, through woods of gloomy cedar, 
Into deep chasms troubled by roaring streams ; 
Or from the top of Lebanon surveyed 
The moonlight desert, and the moonlight sea : 
In these my lonely wanderings I perceived 
What mighty objects do impress then.' forms 
To elevate our intellectual being ; 
And felt, if aught on earth deserves a curse, 
'Tis that worst principle of ill which dooms 
A thing so. great to perish self-consumed. 
— So much for my remorse ! 
Mar. Unhappy Man ! 
Osw. When from these forms I turned to con- 
template 
The World's opinions and her usages, 
I seemed a Being who had passed alone 
Into a region of futurity, 
Whose natural element was freedom 
Mar. Stop — 
I may not, cannot, follow thee. 
Osw. You must. 
I had been nourished by the sickly food 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

Of popular applause. I now perceived 
That we are praised, only as men in us 
Do recognise some image of themselves, 
An abject counterpart of what they are, 
Or the empty thing that they would wish to be. 
I felt that merit has no surer test 
Than obloquy ; that, if we wish to serve 
The world in substance, not deceive by show, 
We must become obnoxious to its hate, 
Or fear disguised in simulated scorn. 
Mar. I pity, can forgive, you ; but those 
wretches — ■ 
That monstrous perfidy ! 
Osiv. Keep down your wrath. 
False Shame discarded, spurious Fame despised, 
Twin sisters both of Ignorance, I found 
Life stretched before me smooth as some broad way 
Cleared for a monarch's progress. Priests might spin 
Theb veil, but not for me — 'twas in fit place 
Among its kindred cobwebs. I had been, 
And in that dream had left my native land, 
One of Love's simple bondsmen — the soft chain 
Was off for ever ; and the men, from whom 
This liberation came, you woidd destroy : 
Join me in thanks for their blind services. 
Mar. 'Tis a strange aching that, when we would 
curse 
And cannot. — You have betrayed me — I have 
done — ■ 
I am content — I know that he is guiltless — 
That both are guiltless, without spot or stain, 
Mutually consecrated. Poor old Man ! 
And I had heart for this, because thou lovedst 
Her who from very infancy had been 
Light to thy path, warmth to thy blood ! — Together 
[Turning to Oswald. 
We propped his steps, he leaned upon us both. 
Osw. Ay, we are coupled by a chain of adamant ; 
Let us be fellow-labourers, then, to enlarge 
Man's intellectual empire. We subsist 
In slavery ; all is slavery ; we receive 
Laws, but we ask not whence those laws have come ; 
We need an inward sting to goad us on. 
Mar. Have you betrayed me ? Speak to that. 
Osw. The mask, 
Which for a season I have stooped to wear, 
Must be cast off. — Know then that I was urged, 
(For other impulse let it pass) was driven, 
To seek for sympathy, because I saw 
In you a mirror of my youthful self ; 
I would have made us equal once again, 
But that was a vain hope. You have struck home, 
With a few drops of blood cut short the business ; 
Therein for ever you must yield to me. 

But what is done will save you from the blank 
Of living without knowledge that you live : 
Now you are suffering — for the future day, 
'Tis his who will command it. — Think of my story — 
Herbert is innocent. 
Mar. (in a faint voice, and doubtingly) You do 
but echo 
My own wild words ? 
Osto. Young Man, the seed must lie 
Hid in the earth, or there can be no harvest ; 
'Tis Nature's law. What I have done in darkness 
I will avow before the face of day. 
Herbert is innocent. 
Mar. What fiend could prompt 
This action \ Innocent ! — oh, breaking heart ! — 
Alive or dead, I ' find him. [Exit. 
.Osw. Alive — perdition ! [Exit. 

Scene, the inside of a poor Cottage. 
Eleanor and Idonea seated. 
Idon. The storm beats hard — Mercy for poor 
or rich, 
Whose heads are shelterless in such a night ! 
A Voice without. Holla ! to bed, good Folks, 
within ! 
Elea. O save us ! 
Idon. What can this mean ? 
Elea. Alas, for my poor husband ! — 
We ' have a counting of our flocks to-morrow ; 
The wolf keeps festival these stormy nights : 
Be calm, sweet Lady, they are wassailers 
[The voices die away in the distance. 
Returning from their Feast — my heart beats so — 
A noise at midnight does so frighten me. 
Idon. Hush ! [Listening. 
Elea. They are gone. On such a night, my 
husband, 
Dragged from Ms bed, was cast into a dungeon, 
Where, hid from me, he counted many years, 
A criminal in no one's eyes but theirs — 
Not even in theirs — whose brutal violence 
So dealt with him. 
Idon.  have a noble Friend 
First among youths of knightly breeding, One 
Who fives but to protect the weak or injured. 
There again ! [Listening. 
Elea. 'Tis my husband's foot. Good Eldred 
Has a kind heart ; but his imprisonment 
Has made him fearful, and he ' never be 
The man he was. 
Idon. I will retire ; — good night ! 
[She goes within. 

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Enter Eldred, (hides a bundle). 
Eld. Not yet in bed, Eleanor ! — there are stains 
in that frock which must be washed out. 
Meet. What has befallen you ? 
Eld.  am belated, and you must know the cause 
— {speaking low) that is the blood of an unhappy 
Man. 
Elect. Oh ! we are undone for ever. 
Eld. Heaven forbid that I should lift my hand 
against any man. Eleanor, I have shed tears to- 
night, and it comforts me to think of it. 
Elea. Where, where is he ? 
Eld. I have done him no harm, but it will 
be forgiven me ; it would not have been so once. 
Elea. You have not buried anything ? You are 
no richer than when you left me ? 
Eld. Be at peace ; I am innocent. 
Elea. Then God be thanked — 
[A short pause i she falls upon his neck. 
Eld. To-night I met with an old Man lying 
stretched upon the ground — a sad spectacle : I 
raised him up with a hope that we might shelter 
and restore him. 
Elea. (as if ready to run). Where is he? You 
were not able to bring him all the way with you ; 
let us return, I can help you. 
[Eldred shakes his head. 
Eld. He did not seem to wish for life : as I was 
struggling on, by the light of the moon I saw the 
stains of blood upon my clothes — he waved his 
hand, as if it were all useless ; and I let him sink 
again to the ground. 
Elea. Oh that I had been by your side ! 
Eld. I tell you his hands and his body were cold 
— how could I disturb his last moments ? he strove 
to turn from me as if he wished to settle into 
sleep. 
Elea. But, for the stains of blood — 
Eld. He must have fallen, I fancy, for his head 
was cut ; but I think his malady was cold and 
hunger. 
Elea. Oh, Eldred, I shall never be able to look 
up at this roof in storm or fair but I shall 
tremble. 
Eld. Is it not enough that my ill stars have kept 
me abroad to-night till this hour ? I come home, 
and this is my comfort ! 
Elea. But did he say nothing which might have 
set you at ease ? 
Eld. I thought he grasped my hand while he 
was muttering something about his Child — his 
Daughter — (starting as if he heard a noise). What 
is that ? 

Elea. Eldred, you are a father. 
Eld. God knows what was in my heart, and will 
not curse my son for my sake. 
Elea. But you prayed by him ? you waited the 
hour of his release ? 
Eld. The night was wasting fast ; I have no 
friend ; I am spited by the world — his wound 
terrified me — if I had brought him along with me, 
and he had died in my arms !  am sure I heard 
something breathing — and this chair ! 
Elea. Oh, Eldred, you will die alone. You will 
have nobody to close your eyes — no hand to grasp 
your dying hand — I shall be in my grave. A curse 
will attend us all. 
Eld. Have you forgot your own troubles when I 
was in the dungeon ? 
Elea. And you left him alive ? 
Eld. Alive ! — the damps of death were upon him 
■ — he could not have survived an hour. 
Elea. In the cold, cold night. 
Eld. (in a savage tone). Ay, and his head was 
bare ; I suppose you would have had me lend my 
bonnet to cover it. — You will never rest till I am 
brought to a felon's end. 
Elea. Is there nothing to be done ? cannot we go 
to the Convent? 
Eld. Ay, and say at once that I murdered 
him ! 
Elea. Eldred, I know that ours is the only house 
upon the Waste ; let us take heart ; this Man may 
be rich ; and could he be saved by our means, hia 
gratitude may reward us. 
Eld. 'Tis all in vain. 
Elea. But let us make the attempt. This old 
Man may have a wife, and he may have children 
— let us return to the spot ; we may restore 
him, and his eyes may yet open upon those that 
love him. 
Eld. He will never open them more ; even when 
he spoke to me, he kept them firmly sealed as 
if he had been blind. 
Idon. (rushing out). It is, it is, my Father — 
Eld. We are betrayed (looking at Idonea). 
Elea. His Daughter ! — God have mercy ! (turn- 
ing to Idonea). 
Idon. (sinking down). Oh ! lift me up and carry 
me to the place. 
You are safe ; the whole world shall not harm you. 
Elea. This Lady is his Daughter. 
Eld. (moved). I ' lead you to the spot. 
Idon. (springing up). Alive ! — you heard him 
breathe ? quick, quick — [Exeunt.

ACT V. 
Scene, A wood on the edge of the Waste. 
Enter Oswald and a Forester. 
For. Heleaneduponthebridgethatspanstheglen, 
And down into the bottom cast his eye, 
That fastened there, as it would check the current. 
Osw. He listened too ; did you not say he listened ? 
For. As if there came such moaning from the 
flood 
As is heard often after stormy nights. 
Osw. But did he utter nothing  
For. See him there ! 
Marmaduke appearing. 
Mar. Buzz, buzz, ye black and winged freebooters ; 
That is no substance which ye settle on ! 
For. His senses play him false ; and see, Ms arras 
Outspread, as if to save himself from falling ! — 
Some terrible phantom I believe is now 
Passing before him, such as God will not 
Permit to visit any but a man 
Who has been guilty of some horrid crime. 
[Marmaduke disappears. 
Osw. The game is up ! — 
For. If it be needful, Sir, 
I will assist you to lay hands upon him. 
Osw. No, no, my Friend, you may pursue your 
business — 
'Tis a poor wretch of an unsettled mind, 
Who has a trick of straying from his keepers ; 
We must be gentle. Leave him to my care. 
[Exit Forester. 
If his own eyes play false with him, these freaks 
Of fancy shall be quickly tamed by mine ; 
The goal is reached. My Master shall become 
A shadow of myself — made by myself. 

Scene, the edge of the Moor. 
Marmajduke and Eldred enter from opposite sides. 
Mar. (raising his eyes and perceiving Eldred). 
In any corner of this savage Waste, 
Have you, good Peasant, seen a blind old Man ? 
Eld. I heard 
Mar. You heard him, where ? when 
heard him  
Eld. As you know, 
The first hours of last night were rough with stonn : 
I had been out in search of a stray heifer ; 
Returning late, I heard a moaning sound ; 
Then, thinking that my fancy had deceived me, 
I hurried on, when straight a second moan, 

A human voice distinct, struck on my ear. 
So guided, distant a few steps, I found 
An aged Man, and such as you describe. 
Mar. You heard ! — he called you to him ? Of all 
men 
The best and kindest ! — but where is he  guide me, 
That I may see him. 
Eld. On a ridge of rocks 
A lonesome Chapel stands, deserted now : 
The bell is left, which no one dares remove ; 
And, when the stormy wind blows o'er the peak, 
It rings, as if a human hand were there 
To pull the cord. I guess he must have heard it ; 
And it had led him towards the precipice, 
To climb up to the spot whence the sound came ; 
But he had failed through weakness. From his 
hand 
His staff had dropped, and close upon the brink 
Of a small pool of water he was laid, 
As if he had stooped to drink, and so remained 
Without the strength to rise. 
Mar. Well, well, he lives, 
And all is safe : what said he ? 
Eld. But few words : 
He only spake to me of a dear Daughter, 
Who, so he feared, would never see him more ; 
And of a Stranger to him, One by whom 
He had been sore misused ; but he forgave 
The wrong and the wrong-doer. You are trou- 
bled— 
Perhaps you are his son ? 
Mar. The All-seeing knows, 
I did not think he had a living Child. — 
But whither did you carry him ? 
Eld. He was torn, 
His head was bruised, and there was blood about 
him 
Mar. That was no work of mine. 
Eld. Nor was it mine. 
Mar. But had he strength to walk ? I could have 
borne him 
A thousand miles. 
Eld. I am in poverty, 
And know how busy are the tongues of men ; 
My heart was willing, Sir, but I am one 
Whose good deeds will not stand by their own light; 
And, though it smote me more than words can tell, 
I left him. 
Mar. I believe that there are phantoms, 
That in the shape of man do cross our path 
On evil instigation, to make sport 
Of our distress — and thou art one of them ! 
But things substantial have so pressed on me 
Eld. My wife and children came into my mind. 

 


POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

Mar. Oh Monster ! Monster ! there are three 
of us, 
And we shall howl together. 
[After a pause and in a feeble voice. 
I am deserted 
At my worst need, my crimes have in a net 
(Pointing to Eldeed) Entangled this poor man. — 
Where was it ? where ? 
[Dragging him along. 
Eld. 'Tis needless ; spare your violence. His 
Daughter 
• Mar. Ay, in the word a thousand scorpions lodge: 
This old man had a Daughter. 
Eld. To the spot 
I hurried back with her. — save me, Sir, 
From such a journey ! there was a black tree, 
A single tree ; she thought it was her Father. — 
Oh Sir, I would not see-that hour again 
For twenty lives. The daylight dawned, and now — ■ 
Nay ; hear my tale, 'tis fit that you should hear it — 
As we approached, a solitary crow 
Rose from the spot ; — the Daughter clapped her 
hands, 
And then I heard a shriek so terrible 
[Marmaduke shri?iks back. 
The startled bird quivered upon the wing. 
Mar. Dead, dead ! — 
Eld. (after a pause). A dismal matter, Sir, forme, 
And seems the like for you ; if 'tis your wish, 
I ' lead you to his Daughter ; but 'twere best 
That she should be prepared ; I ' go before. 
Mar. There will be need of preparation. 
[Eldred goes off- 
Elea. (enters). Master ! 
Your limbs sink under you, shall I support you ? 
Mar. (talcing her arm). Woman, I 've lent my 
body to the service 
Which now thou tak'st upon thee. God forbid 
That thou shouldst ever meet a like occasion 
With such a purpose in thine heart as mine was. 
Elea. Oh, why have I to do with things like these? 
[Exeunt. 

Scene changes to the door of Eldred's cottage — 
Idonea seated — enter Eldred. 
Eld. Your Father, Lady, from a wilful hand 
Has met unkindness ; so indeed he told me, 
And you remember such was my report : 
From what has just befallen me I have cause 
To fear the very worst. 
Idon. My Father is dead ; 
Why dost thou come to me with words like these ? 
Eld. A wicked Man should answer for his crimes. 

Idon. Thou seest me what I am. 
Eld. It was most heinous, 
And doth call out for vengeance. 
Idon. Do not add, 
I prithee, to the harm thou 'st done already. 
Eld. Hereafter you will thank me for this service. 
Hard by, a Man I met, who, from plain proofs 
Of interfering Heaven, I have no doubt, 
Laid hands upon your Father. Fit it were 
You should prepare to meet him. 
Idon. I have nothing 
To do with others ; help me to my Father — 
[She turns and sees Marmaduke leaning on Eleanor 
— throws herself upon his neck, and after some 
time, 
In joy I met thee, but a few hours past ; 
And thus we meet again ; one human stay 
Is left me still in thee. Nay, shake not so. 
Mar. In such a wilderness — to see no thing, 
No, not the pitying moon ! 
Idon. And perish so. 
Mar. Without a dog to moan for him. 
Idon. Think not of it, 
But enter there and see him how he sleeps, 
Tranquil as he had died in his own bed. 
Mar. Tranquil — why not ? 
Idon. Oh, peace ! 
Mar. He is at peace ; 
His body is at rest : there was a plot, 
A hideous plot, against the soul of man : 
It took effect — and yet I baffled it, 
In some degree. 
Idon. Between us stood, I thought, 
A cup of consolation, filled from Heaven 
For both our needs ; must I, and in thy presence, 
Alone partake of it ? — Beloved Marmaduke ! 
Mar. Give me a reason why the wisest thing 
That the earth owns shall never choose to die, 
But some one must be near to count his groans. 
The wounded deer retires to solitude, 
And dies in solitude : all things but man, 
All die in solitude. 
[Moving towards the cottage door. 
Mysterious God, 
If she had never lived I had not done it ! — 
Idon. Alas, the thought of such a cruel death 
Has overwhelmed him. — I must follow. 
Eld. Lady ! 
You will do well ; (she goes) unjust suspicion may 
Cleave to this Stranger : if, upon his entering, 
The dead Man heave a groan, or from his side 
Uplift his hand — that would be evidence. 
Elea. Shame ! Eldred, shame ! 
Mar. (both returning) The dead have but 
one face, (to himself). 

THE BORDERERS. 

 

And such a Man — so meek and unoffending — 
Helpless and harmless as a babe : a Man, 
By obvious signal to the world's protection 
Solemnly dedicated — to decoy him ! — 
Idon. Oh, had you seen him living ! — 
Mar. I (so filled 
With horror is this world) am unto thee 
The thing most precious, that it now contains : 
Therefore through me alone must be revealed 
By whom thy Parent was destroyed, Idonea ! 
I have the proofs ! — 
Idon. miserable Father ! 
Thou didst command me to bless all mankind ; 
Nor to this moment, have I ever wished 
Evil to any living thing ; but hear me, 
Hear me, ye Heavens ! — (Jcneeling) — may venge- 
ance haunt the fiend 
For this most cruel murder : let him live 
And move in terror of the elements ; 
The thunder send him on his knees to prayer 
In the open streets, and let him think he sees, 
If e'er he entereth the house of God, 
The roof, self-moved, unsettling o'er his head ; 
And let him, when he would lie down at night, 
Point to his wife the blood-drops on his pillow ! 
Mar. My voice was silent, but my heart hath 
joined thee. 
Idon. (leaning on Marmaduke). Left to the 
mercy of that savage Man ! 
How could he call upon his Child ! — Friend ! 
[Turns to Makjiaduke. 
My faithful true and only Comforter. 
Mar. Ay, come to me and weep. (He Jcisses her.) 
(To Eldred). Yes, Varlet, look, 
The devils at such sights do clap their hands. 
[Eldred retires alarmed. 
Idon. Thy vest is torn, thy cheek is deadly pale ; 
Hast thou pursued the monster \ 
Mar. I have found him. — 
Oh ! would that thou hadst perished in the flames ! 
Idon. Here art thou, then can I be desolate ? — 
Mar. There was a time, when this protecting hand 
Availed against the mighty ; never more 
Shall blessings wait upon a deed of mine. 
Idon. Wild words for me to hear, for me, an 
orphan, 
Committed to thy guardianship by Heaven ; 
And, if thou hast forgiven me, let me hope, 
In this deep sorrow, trust, that I am thine 
For closer care ; — here, is no malady. 
[Taking his arm. 
Mar. There, is a malady — 
(Striking his heart and forehead) And here, and 
here, 

A mortal malady. — I am accurst : 
All nature curses me, and in my heart 
Thy curse is fixed ; the truth must be laid bare. 
It must be told, and borne. I am the man, 
(Abused, betrayed, but how it matters not) 
Presumptuous above all that ever breathed, 
Who, casting as I thought a guilty Person 
Upon Heaven's righteous judgment, did become 
An instrument of Fiends. Through me, through me . 
Thy Father perished. 
Idon. Perished — by what mischance ? 
Mar. Beloved ! — if I dared, so would I call thee — 
Conflict must cease, and, in thy frozen heart, 
The extremes of suffering meet in absolute peace. 
[lie gives her a letter. 
Idon. (reads) Be not surprised if you hear 
that some signal judgment has befallen the man 
who calls himself your father ; he is now with 
me, as his signature will shew : abstain from con- 
jecture till you see me. 
' Herbert. 
' Marmaduke.' 
The writing Oswald's ; the signature my Father's : 
(Looks steadily at the paper) And here is yours, — 
or do my eyes deceive me ? 
You have then seen my Father ? 
Mar. He has leaned 
Upon this arm. 
Idon. You led him towards the Convent ? 
Mar. That Convent was Stone-Arthur Castle. 
Thither 
We were his guides. I on that night resolved 
That he should wait thy coming till the day 
Of resurrection. 
Idon. Miserable Woman, 
Too quickly moved, too easily giving way, 
 put denial on thy suit, and hence, 
With the disastrous issue of last night, 
Thy perturbation, and these frantic words. 
Be calm, I pray thee ! 
Mar. Oswald 
Idon. Name him not. 
Enter female Beggar. 
Beg. And he is dead ! — that Moor — how shall 
I cross it ? 
By night, by day, never shall I be able 
To travel half a mile alone. — Good Lady ! 
Forgive me ! — Saints forgive me. Had I thought 
It would have come to this ! — 
Idon. What brings you hither ? speak ! 
Beg. (pointing to Marmaduke). This innocent 
Gentleman. Sweet heavens ! I told him 
Such tales of your dead Father ! — God is my judge, 
E  

 

POEMS WRITTEN IN YOUTH. 

I thought there was no harm : but that bad Man, 
He bribed me with his gold, and looked so fierce. 
Mercy ! I said I know not what — oh pity me — 
I said, sweet Lady, you were not his Daughter — 
Pity me, I am haunted ; — thrice this day 
My conscience made me wish to be struck blind ; 
And then I would have prayed, and had no voice. 
Idon. (to Marmadtjke). Was it my Father ? — 
no, no, no, for he 
Was meek and patient, feeble, old and blind, 
Helpless, and loved me dearer than his life. 
— But hear me. For one qiiestion, I have a heart 
That will sustain me. Did you murder him ? 
Mar. No, not by stroke of arm. But learn the 
process : 
Proof after proof was pressed upon me ; guilt 
Made evident, as seemed, by blacker guilt, 
Whose impious folds enwrapped even thse ; and truth 
And innocence, embodied in his looks, 
His words and tones and gestures, did but serve 
With me to aggravate his crimes, and heaped 
Ruin upon the cause for which they pleaded. 
Then pity crossed the path of my resolve : 
Confounded, I looked up to Heaven, and cast, 
Idonea ! thy blind Father, on the Ordeal 
Of the bleak Waste — left him — and so he died ! — 
[Idonea sinks senseless ; Beggar, Eleanor, fyc, 
crowd round, and bear her off. 
Why may we speak these things, and do no more ; 
Why should a thrust of the arm have such a power, 
And words that tell these things be heard in vain  
She is not dead. Why ! — if I loved this Woman, 
I would take care she never woke again ; 
But she will wake, and she will weep for me, 
And say, no blame was mine — and so, poor fool, 
Will waste her curses on another name. 
[He walks about distractedly. 
Enter Oswald. 
Oswald (to himself). Strong to o'erturn, strong 
also to buildup. [To Marmaduke. 
The starts and sallies of our last encounter 
Were natural enough ; but that, I trust, 
Is all gone by. You have cast off the chains 
That fettered your nobility of mind — 
Delivered heart and head ! 
Let us to Palestine ; 
This is a paltry field for enterprise. 
Mar. Ay, what shall we encounter next ? This 
issue — 
'Twas nothing more than darkness deepening 
darkness, 
And weakness crowned with the impotence of 
death ! — 
Your pupil is, you see, an apt proficient, (ironically) . 

Start not ! — Here is another face hard by ; 
Come, let us take a peep at both together, 
And, with a voice at which the dead will quake, 
Resound the praise of your morality — 
Of this too much. 
[Drawing Oswald towards the Cottage — stops short 
at the door. 
Men are there, millions, Oswald, 
Who with bare hands would have plucked out thy 
heart 
And flung it to the dogs : but I am raised 
Above, or sunk below, all further sense 
Of provocation. Leave me, with the weight 
Of that old Man's forgiveness on thy heart, 
Pressing as heavily as it doth on mine. 
Coward I have been ; know, there lies not now 
Within the compass of a mortal thought, 
A deed that I would shrink from ; — but to endure, 
That is my destiny. May it be thine : 
Thy office, thy ambition, be henceforth 
To feed remorse, to welcome every sting 
Of penitential anguish, yea with tears. 
When seas and continents shall lie between us — ■ 
The wider space the better — we may find 
In such a course fit links of sympathy, 
An incommunicable rivalship 
Maintained, for peaceful ends beyond our view. 
[Confused voices — several of the band enter — rush 
upon Oswald and seize him. 
One of them. I would have dogged him to the 
jaws of hell — 
Osw. Ha ! is it so ! — That vagrant Hag ! — this 
comes 
Of having left a thing like her alive ! [Aside. 
Several voices. Despatch him ! 
Osw. If I pass beneath a rock 
And shout, and, with the echo of my voice, 
Bring down a heap of rubbish, and it crush me, 
I die without dishonour. Famished, starved, 
A Fool and Coward blended to my wish ! 
[Smiles scornfully and exultingly at Marmaduke. 
Wal. 'Tis done ! (stabs him.) 
Another of the band. The ruthless Traitor ! 
Mar. A rash deed ! — 
With that reproof I do resign a station 
Of which I have been proud. 
Wil. (approaching Marmaduke). my poor 
Master ! 
Mar. Discerning Monitor, my faithful Wilfred, 
Why art thou here % [Turning to Wallace. 
Wallace, upon these Borders, 
Many there be whose eyes will not want cause 
To weep that I am gone. Brothers in arms ! 
Raise on that dreary Waste a monument

That may record my story : nor let words — 
Few must they be, and delicate in their touch 
As light itself — be there withheld from Her 
Who, through most wicked arts, was made an 
orphan 
By One who would have died a thousand times, 
To shield her from a moment's harm. To you, 
Wallace and Wilfred, I commend the Lady, 
By lowly nature reared, as if to make her 
In all things worthier of that noble birth, 
Whose long-suspended rights are now on the eve 
Of restoration : with your tenderest care 
Watch over her, I pray — sustain her 
Several of the band (eagerly). Captain ! 
Mar. No more of that ; in silence hear my doom : 

A hermitage has furnished fit relief 
To some offenders ; other penitents, 
Less patient in their wretchedness, have fallen, 
Like the old Roman, on their own sword's point. 
They had their choice : a wanderer must I go, 
The Spectre of that innocent Man, my guide. 
No human ear shall ever hear me speak ; 
No human dwelling ever give me food, 
Or sleep, or rest : but, over waste and wild, 
In search of nothing, that this earth can give, 
But expiation, will I wander on — 
A Man by pain and thought compelled to live, 
Yet loathing life— till anger is appeased 
In Heaven, and Mercy gives me leave to die.

POEMS REFERRING TO THE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD. 

My heart leaps up when I behold 
A rainbow in the sky : 
So was it when my life began ; 
So is it now I ani a man ; 
So be it when I shall grow old, 
Or let me die ! 
The Child is father of the Man ; 
And I could wish my days to be 
Bound each to each by natural piety. 

TO A BUTTERFLY. 
Stay near me — do not take thy flight ! 
A little longer stay in sight ! 
Much converse do I find in thee, 
Historian of my infancy ! 
Float near me ; do not yet depart ! 
Dead times revive in thee : 
Thou bring'st, gay creature as thou art ! 
A solemn image to my heart, 
My father's family ! 
Oh ! pleasant, pleasant were the days, 
The time, when, in our childish plays, 
My sister Emmeline and I 
Together chased the butterfly ! 
A very hunter did I rush 
Upon the prey : — with leaps and springs 
I followed on from brake to bush ; 
But she, God love her ! feared to brush 
The dust from off its wings. 

THE SPARROW'S NEST. 
Behold, within the leafy shade, 
Those bright blue eggs together laid ! 
On me the chance-discovered sight 
Gleamed like a vision of delight. 
I started — seeming to espy 
The home and sheltered bed, 

The Sparrow's dwelling, which, hard by 
My Father's house, in wet or dry 
My sister Emmeline and I 
Together visited. 
She looked at it and seemed to fear it ; 
Dreading, tho' wishing, to be near it • 
Such heart was in hex', being then 
A little Prattler among men. 
The Blessing of my later years 
Was with me when a boy : 
She gave me eyes, she gave me ears ; 
And humble cares, and delicate fears ; 
A heart, the fountain of sweet tears ; 
And love, and thought, and joy. 

FORESIGHT. 

That is work of waste and ruin — 
Do as Charles and I are doing ! 
Strawberry-blossoms, one and all, 
We must spare them — here are many : 
Look at it — the flower is small, 
Small and low, though fair as any : 
Do not touch it ! summers two 
I am older, Anne, than you. 
Pull the primrose, sister Anne ! 
Pull as many as you can. 
— Here are daisies, take your fill ; 
Pansies, and the cuckoo-flower : 
Of the lofty daffodil 
Make your bed, or make your bower ; 
Fill your lap, and fill your bosom ; 
Only spare the strawberry-blossom ! 
Primroses, the Spring may love them — 
Summer knows but little of them : 
Violets, a barren kind, 
Withered on the ground must he ; 
Daisies leave no fruit behind 
When the pretty flowerets die ; 
Pluck them, and another year 
As many will be blowing here. 

THE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD. 

 

God has given a kindlier power 
To the favoured strawberry-flower. 
Hither soon as spring is fled 
You and Charles and I will walk ; 
Lurking berries, ripe and red, 
Then M'ill hang on every stalk, 
Each within its leafy bower ; 
And for that promise spare the flower ! 

CHARACTERISTICS OF A CHILD THREE 
YEARS OLD. 
Loving she is, and tractable, though wild ; 
And Innocence hath privilege in her 
To dignify arch looks and laughing eyes ; 
And feats of cunning ; and the pretty round 
Of trespasses, affected to provoke 
Mock- chastisement and partnership in play. 
And, as a faggot sparkles on the hearth, 
Not less if unattended and alone 
Than when both young and old sit gathered round 
And take delight in its activity ; 
Even so this happy Creature of herself 
Is all-sufficient ; solitude to her 
Is blithe society, who fills the air 
With gladness and involuntary songs. 
Light are her sallies as the tripping fawn's 
Forth-startled from the fern where she lay couched ; 
Unthought-of, unexpected, as the stir 
Of the soft breeze ruffling the meadow-flowers, 
Or from before it chasing wantonly 
The many-coloured images imprest 
Upon the bosom of a placid lake. 

ADDRESS TO A CHILD, 
DURING A BOISTEROUS WINTER EVENING. 
BY MY SISTER. 
What way does the Wind come ? What way does 
he go ? 
He rides over the water, and over the snow, 
Through wood, and through vale ; and, o'er rocky 
height 
Which the goat cannot climb, takes his sounding 
flight ; 
He tosses about in every bare tree, 
As, if you look up, you plainly may see ; 

But how he will come, and whither he goes, 
There 's never a scholar in England knows. 
He will suddenly stop in a cunning nook, 
And ring a sharp 'larum ; — but, if you should look, 
There 's nothing to see but a cushion of snow 
Round as a pillow, and whiter than milk, 
And softer than if it were covered with silk. 
Sometimes he ' hide in the cave of a rock, 
Then whistle as shrill as the buzzard cock ; 
— Yet seek him,— and what shall you find in the 
place  
Nothing but silence and empty space ; 
Save, in a corner, a heap of dry leaves, 
That he's left, for a bed, to beggars or thieves ! 
As soon as 'tis daylight to-morrow, with me 
You shall go to the orchard, and then you will see 
That he has been there, and made a great rout, 
And cracked the branches, and strewn them about ; 
Heaven grant that he spare but that one upright 
twig 
That looked up at the sky so proud and big 
All last summer, as well you know, 
Studded with apples, a beautiful show ! 
Hark ! over the roof he makes a pause, 
And growls as if he would fix his claws 
Right in the slates, and with a huge rattle 
Drive them down, like men in a battle : 
— But let him range round ; he does us no harm. 
We build up the fire, we 're snug and warm ; 
Untouched by his breath see the candle shinesbright, 
And burns with a clear and steady light ; 
Books have we to read,— but that half-stifled knell, 
Alas ! 'tis the sound of the eight o'clock bell. 
— Come now we ' to bed ! and when we are there 
He may work his own will, and what shall we care ? 
He may knock at the door, — we ' not let him in ; 
May drive at the windows, — we ' laugh at his din ; 
Let him seek his own home wherever it be ; 
Here 's a cozie warm house for Edward and me.

THE MOTHER'S RETURN. 

BY THE SAME. 

A month, sweet Little-ones, is past 
Since your dear Mother went away,- 
And she to-morrow will return ; 
To-morrow is the happy day. 

 

POEMS REFERRING TO 

blessed tidings ! thought of joy ! 
The eldest heard with steady glee ; 
Silent he stood ; then laughed amain,— 
And shouted, " Mother, come to me !" 
Louder and louder did he shout, 
With witless hope to bring her near ; 
" Nay, patience ! patience, little boy ! 
Your tender mother cannot hear." 
 told of hills, and far-off towns, 
And long, long vales to travel through ; — 
He listens, puzzled, sore perplexed, 
But he submits ; what can he do ? 
No strife disturbs his sister's breast ; 
She wars not with the mystery 
Of time and distance, night and day ; 
The bonds of our humanity. 
Her joy is like an instinct, joy 
Of kitten, bird, or summer fly ; 
She dances, runs without an aim, 
She chatters in her ecstasy. 
Her brother now takes up the note, 
And echoes back his sister's glee ; 
They hug the infant in my arms, 
As if to force his sympathy. 
Then, settling into fond discourse, 
We rested in the garden bower ; 
While sweetly shone the evening sun 
In his departing hour. 
We told o'er all that we had done, — 
Our rambles by the swift brook's side 
Far as the willow-skirted pool, 
Where two fair swans together glide. 
We talked of change, of winter gone, 
Of green leaves on the hawthorn spray, 
Of birds that build their nests and sing 
And all " since Mother went away ! " 
To her these tales they will repeat, 
To her our new-born tribes will show, 
The goslings green, the ass's colt, 
The lambs that in the meadow go. 
. — But, see, the evening star comes forth ! 
To bed the children must depart ; 
A moment's heaviness they feel, 
A sadness at the heart : 

'Tis gone — and in a merry fit 
They run up stairs in gamesome race ; 
I, too, infected by their mood, 
I could have joined the wanton chase. 
Five minutes past — and, the change ! 
Asleep upon their beds they lie ; 
Their busy limbs in perfect rest, 
And closed the sparkling eye.

VIII. 
ALICE FELL; 
OR, FOVERTY. 

The post-boy drove with fierce career, 
For threatening clouds the moon had drowned ; 
When, as we hurried on, my ear 
Was smitten with a startling sound. 
As if the wind blew many ways, 
I heard the sound, — and more and more ; 
It seemed to follow with the chaise, 
And still I heard it as before. 
At length I to the boy called out ; 
He stopped his horses at the word, 
But neither cry, nor voice, nor shout, 
Nor aught else like it, could be heard. 
The boy then smacked his whip, and fast 
The horses scampered through the rain ; 
But, hearing soon upon the blast 
The cry, I bade him halt again. . 
Forthwith alighting on the ground, 
" Whence comes," said I, " this piteous moan ? " 
And there a little Girl I found, 
Sitting behind the chaise, alone. 
" My cloak !" no other word she spake, 
But loud and bitterly she wept, 
As if her innocent heart would break ; 
And down from off her seat she leapt. 
" What ails you, child ?" — she sobbed "Look here !' 
I saw it in the wheel entangled, 
A weather-beaten rag as e'er 
From any garden scare-crow dangled. 
There, twisted between nave and spoke, 
It hung, nor could at once be freed ; 
But our joint pains unloosed the cloak, 
A miserable rag indeed ! 

THE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD. 

 

« And whither are you going, child, 
To-night along these lonesome ways V 
" To Durham," answered she, half wild — 
" Then come with me into the chaise." 
Insensible to all relief 
Sat the poor girl, and forth did send 
Sob after sob, as if her grief 
Could never, never have an end. 
" My child, in Durham do you dwell " 
She checked herself in her distress, 
And said, " My name is Alice Fell ; 
I'm fatherless and motherless. 
And I to Durham, Sir, belong." 
Again, as if the thought would choke 
Her very heart, her grief grew strong ; 
And all was for her tattered cloak ! 
The chaise drove on ; our journey's end 
Was nigh ; and, sitting by my side, 
As if she had lost her only friend 
She wept, nor would be pacified. 
Up to the tavern-door we post ; 
Of Alice and her grief I told ; 
And I gave money to the host, 
To buy a new cloak for the old. 
« And let it be of duffil grey, 
As warm a cloak as man can sell !" 
Proud creature was she the next day, 
The little orphan, Alice Fell ! 

IX. 
LUCY GRAY; 
OB, SOLITUDE. 

Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray : 
And, when I crossed the wild, 
I chanced to see at break of day 
The solitary child. 
No mate, no comrade Lucy knew ; 
She dwelt on a wide moor, 
— The sweetest thing that ever grew 
Beside a human door ! 

You yet may spy the fawn at play, 
The hare upon the green ; 
But the sweet face of Lucy Gray 
Will never more be seen. 
" To-night will be a stormy night — 
You to the town must go ; 
And take a lantern, Child, to light 
Your mother through the snow." 
" That, Father ! will I gladly do : 
'Tis scarcely afternoon — 
The minster-clock has just struck two, 
And yonder is the moon '" 
At this the Father raised his hook, 
And snapped a faggot-band ; 
He plied his work ; — and Lucy took 
The lantern in her hand. 
Not blither is the mountain roe : 
With many a wanton stroke 
Her feet disperse the powdery snow, 
That rises up like smoke. 
The storm came on before its time : 
She wandered up and down ; 
And many a hill did Lucy climb : 
But never reached the town. 
The wretched parents all that night 
Went shouting far and wide ; 
But there was neither sound nor sight 
To serve them for a guide. 
At day-break on a hill they stood 
That overlooked the moor ; 
And thence they saw the bridge of wood, 
A furlong from their door. 
They wept — and, turning homeward, cried, 
" In heaven we all shall meet ;" 
— When in the snow the mother spied 
The print of Lucy's feet. 
Then downwards from the steep hill's edge 
They tracked the footmarks small ; 
And through the broken hawthorn hedge, 
And by the long stone-wall ; 
And then an open field they crossed : 
The marks were still the same ; 
They tracked them on, nor ever lost ; 
And to the bridge they came. 

 

POEMS REFERRING TO 

They followed from the snowy bank 
Those footmarks, one by one, 
Into the middle of the plank ; 
And further there were none ! 
— Yet some maintain that to this day 
She is a living child ; 
That you may see sweet Lucy Gray 
Upon the lonesome wild. 

O'er rough and smooth she trips 
And never looks behind ; 
And sings a solitary song 
That whistles in the wind. 

. 

WE ARE SEVEN. 
A simple Child, 

That lightly draws its breath, 
And feels its life in every limb, 
What should it know of death ? 
I met a little cottage Girl : 
She was eight years old, she said ; 
Her hair was thick with many a curl 
That clustered round her head. 
She had a rustic, woodland air, 
And she was wildly clad : 
Her eyes were fair, and very fair ; 
— Her beauty made me glad. 
" Sisters and brothers, little Maid, 
How many may you be " 
" How many ? Seven hi all," she said, 
And wondering looked at me. 
" And where are they ? I pray you tell." 
She answered, " Seven are we ; 
And two of us at Conway dwell, 
And two are gone to sea. 
Two of us in the church-yard lie, 
My sister and my brother ; 
And, in the church-yard cottage, I 
Dwell near them with my mother." 
u You say that two at Conway dwell, 
And two are gone to sea, 
Yet ye are seven ! — I pray you tell, 
Sweet Maid, how this may be." 

Then did the little Maid reply, 
" Seven boys and girls are we ; 
Two of us in the church-yard lie, 
Beneath the church-yard tree." 
" You run about, my little Maid, 
Your limbs they are alive ; 
If two are in the church-yard laid, 
Then ye are only five." 
" Their graves are green, they may be seen," 
The little Maid replied, 
" Twelve steps or more from my mother's door. 
And they are side by side. 
My stockings there I often knit, 
My kerchief there I hem ; 
And there upon the ground I sit, 
And sing a song to them. 
And often after sun-set, Sir, 
When it is light and fair, 
I take my little porringer, 
And eat my supper there. 
The first that died was sister Jane ; 
In bed she moaning lay, 
Till God released her of her pain ; 
And then she went away. 
So in the church-yard she was laid ; 
And, when the grass was dry, 
Together round her grave we played, 
My brother John and I. 
And when the ground was white with snow, 
And I could run and slide, 
My brother John was forced to go, 
And he lies by her side." 
" How many are you, then," said I, 
" If they two are in heaven I" 
Quick was the little Maid's reply, 
" Master ! we are seven." 
a But they are dead ; those two are dead ! 
Their spirits are in heaven !" 
'Twas throwing words away ; for still 
The little Maid would have her will, 
And said, " Nay, we are seven !" 
.

THE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD. 

 

THE IDLE SHEPHERD-BOYS; 
OR, DUNGEON-GHYLL FORCE. 

A PASTORAL. 

The valley rings with mirth and joy ; 
Among the hills the echoes play 
A never never ending song, 
To welcome in the May. 
The magpie chatters with delight ; 
The mountain raven's youngling hrood 
Have left the mother and the nest ; 
And they go rambling east and west 
In search of their own food ; 
Or through the glittering vapours dart 
In very wantonness of heart. 
Beneath a rock, upon the grass, 
Two hoys are sitting in the sun ; 
Their work, if any work they have, 
Is out of mind — or done. 
On pipes of sycamore they play 
The fragments of a Christmas hymn ; 
Or with that plant which in our dale 
We call stag-horn, or fox's tail, 
Their rusty hats they trim : 
And thus, as happy as the day, 
Those Shepherds wear the time away. 
Along the river's stony marge 
The sand-lark chants a joyous song ; 
The thrush is busy in the wood, 
And carols loud and strong. 
A thousand lambs are on the -rocks, 
All newly born ! both earth and sky 
Keep jubilee, and more than all, 
Those boys with their green coronal ; 
They never hear the cry, 
That plaintive cry ! which up the hill 
Comes from the depth of Dungeon-Ghyll. 
Said Walter, leaping from the ground, 
I Down to the stump of yon old yew 
We ' for our whistles run a race." 
Away the shepherds flew ; 
They leapt — they ran — and when they came 
Right opposite to Dungeon-Ghyll, 

 Ghyll, in the dialect of Cumberland and Westmore- 
land, is a short and, for the most part, a steep narrow 
valley, with a stream running through it. Force is the 
word universally employed in these dialects for waterfall. 

Seeing that he should lose the prize, 
" Stop ! " to his comrade Walter cries — 
James stopped with no good will : 
Said Walter then, exulting ; " Here 
You ' find a task for half a year. 
Cross, if you dare, where I shall cross — 
Come on, and tread where I shall tread." 
The other took him at his word, 
And followed as he led. 
It was a spot which you may see 
If ever you to Langdale go ; 
Into a chasm a mighty block 
Hath fallen, and made a bridge of rock : 
The gulf is deep below ; 
And, in a basin black and small, 
Receives a lofty waterfall. 
With staff in hand across the cleft 
The challenger pursued his march ; 
And now, all eyes and feet, hath gained 
The middle of the arch. 
When list ! he hears a piteous moan — 
Again ! — his heart within him dies — 
His pulse is stopped, his breath is lost, 
He totters, pallid as a ghost, 
And, looking down, espies 
A lamb, that in the pool is pent 
Within that black and frightful rent. 
The lamb had slipped into the stream, 
And safe without a bruise or wound 
The cataract had borne him down 
Into the gulf profound. 
His dam had seen him when he fell, 
She saw him down the torrent borne ; 
And, while with all a mother's love 
She from the lofty rocks above 
Sent forth a cry forlorn, 
The lamb, still swimming round and round, 
Made answer to that plaintive sound. 
When he had learnt what thing it was, 
That sent this rueful cry ; I ween 
The Boy recovered heart, and told 
The sight which he had seen. 
Both gladly now deferred their task ; 
Nor was there wanting other aid — 
A Poet, one who loves the brooks 
Far better than the sages' books, 
By chance had thither strayed ; 
And there the helpless lamb he found 
By those huge rocks encompassed round. 

 

POEMS REFERRING TO 

He drew it from the troubled pool. 
And brought it forth into the light : 
The Shepherds met him with his charge, 
An unexpected sight ! 
Into their arms the lamb they took, 
Whose life and limbs the flood had spared ; 
Then up the steep ascent they hied, 
And placed him at his mother's side ; 
And gently did the Bard 
Those idle Shepherd-boys upbraid, 
And bade them better mind their trade. 
. 

ANECDOTE FOR FATHERS, 
' Eetine vim istam, falsa enim dicam, si coges.' 
Eusbbius. 
I have a boy of five years old ; 
His face is fair and fresh to see ; 
His limbs are cast in beauty's mould, 
And dearly he loves me. 
One morn we strolled on our dry walk, 
Our quiet home all full in view, 
And held such intermitted talk 
As we are wont to do. 
My thoughts on former pleasures ran ; 
I thought of Kilve's delightful shore, 
Our pleasant home when spring began, 
A long, long year before. 
A day it was when I could bear 
Some fond regrets to entertain ; 
With so much happiness to spare, 
I could not feel a pain. 
The green earth echoed to the feet 
Of lambs that bounded through the glade, 
From shade to sunshine, and as fleet 
From sunshine back to shade. 
Birds warbled round me — and each trace 
Of inward sadness had its charm ; 
Kilve, thought I, was a favoured place, 
And so is Liswyn farm. 
My boy beside me tripped, so slim 
And graceful in his rustic dress ! 
And, as we talked, I questioned him, 
In very idleness. 

" Now tell me, had you rather be," 
I said, and took him by the arm, 
" On Kilve's smooth shore, by the green sea, 
Or here at Liswyn farm ? " 
In careless mood he looked at me, 
While still I held him by the arm, 
And said, " At Kilve I 'd rather be 
Than here at Liswyn farm." 
" Now, little Edward, say why so : 
My little Edward, tell me why." — 
" I cannot tell, I do not know." — 
" Why, this is strange," said I ; 
" For, here are woods, hills smooth and warm ; 
There surely must some reason be 
Why you would change sweet Liswyn farm 
For Kilve by the green sea." 
At this, my boy hung down his head, 
He blushed with shame, nor made reply ; 
And three times to the child I said, 
" Why, Edward, tell me why ? " 
His head he raised — there was in sight, 
It caught Ms eye, he saw it plain — 
Upon the house-top, glittering bright, 
A broad and gilded vane. 
Then did the boy his tongue unlock, 
And eased his mind with this reply : 
" At Kilve there was no weather-cock ; 
And that 's the reason why." 
dearest, dearest boy ! my heart 
For better lore would seldom yearn, 
Could I but teach the hundredth part 
Of what from thee I learn.

XIII. 
RURAL ARCHITECTURE. 
There's George Fisher, Charles Fleming, and 
Reginald Shore, 
Three rosy-cheeked school-boys, the highest not 
more 
Than the height of a counsellor's bag j 
To the top of Great How did it please them to 
climb : 

 Great How is a single and conspicuous hill, which 
rises towards the foot of Thirlmere, on the western side of 


THE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD. 

 

And there they built up, without mortar or lime, 
! A Man on the peak of the crag. 
They built him of stones gathered up as they lay : 
They built him and christened him all in one day, 
An urchin both vigorous and hale ; 
And so without scruple they called him Ralph Jones. 
Now Ralph is renowned for the length of his bones; 
The Magog of Legberthwaite dale. 
Just half a week after, the wind sallied forth, 
And, in anger or merriment, out of the north, 
Coming on with a terrible pother, 
From the peak of the crag blew the giant away. 
And what did these school-boys  — The very next 
day 
They went and they built up another. 
—Some little I 've seen of blind boisterous works 
By Christian disturbers more savage than Turks, 
Spirits busy to do and undo : 
At remembrance whereof my blood sometimes will 
flag; 
Then, light-hearted Boys, to the top of the crag ; 
And I ' build up a giant with you. 

XIV. 
THE PET-LAMB. 

A PASTOItAL. 
The dew was falling fast, the stars began to blink ; 
I heard a voice ; it said, " Drink, pretty creature, 
drink!" 
And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied 
A snow-white mountain-lamb with a Maiden at its 
side. 
Nor sheep nor kine were near ; the lamb was all 
alone, 
And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone ; 
With one knee on the grass did the little Maiden 
kneel, 
While to that mountain-lamb she gave its evening 
meal. 
The lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper 
took, 
Seemed to feast with head and ears ; and his tail 
with pleasure shook. 

the beautiful dale of Legberthwaite, along the high road 
between Keswick and Ambleside. 

" Drink, pretty creature, drink," she said in such 
a tone 
That I almost received her heart into my own. 
'Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child of beauty 
rare ! 
I watched them with delight, they were a lovely pair. 
Now with her empty can the maiden turned away : 
But ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she 
stay. 
Right towards the lamb she looked ; and from a 
shady place 
I unobserved could see the workings of her face : 
If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers 
bring, 
Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little Maid might 
sing: 
" What ails thee, young One ? what  Why pull 
so at thy cord ? 
Is itnot well with thee ? well both for bed and board? 
Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be ; 
Rest, little young One, rest ; what is 't that aileth 
thee ? 
What is it thou wouldst seek ? What is wanting 
to thy heart  
Thy limbs are they not strong ? And beautiful 
thou art : 
This grass is tender grass ; these flowers they have 
no peers ; 
And that green com all day is rustling in thy ears ! 
If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen 
chain, 
This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain ; 
For rain and mountain-storms ! the like thou 
need'st not fear, 
The rain and storm are things that scarcely can 
come here. 
Rest, little young One, rest ; thou hast forgot the day 
When my father found thee first in places far away ; 
Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned 
by none, 
And thy mother from thy side for evermore was 
gone. 
He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee 
home : 
A blessed day for thee ! then whither wouldst 
thou roam ? 

POEMS REFERRING TO 

A faithful nurse thou hast ; the dam that did thee 
yean 
Upon the mountain tops no kinder could have been. 
Thou know'st that twice a day I have brought thee 
in this can 
Fresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran ; 
And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with 
dew, 
I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is and 
new. 
Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they 
are now, 
Then I ' yoke thee to my cart like a pony in the 
plough ; 
My playmate thou shalt be ; and when the wind is 
cold 
Our hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be 
thy fold. 
It will not, will not rest ! — Poor creature, can it be 
That 'tis thy mother's heart which is working so 
in thee ? 
Things that I know not of belike to thee are dear, 
And dreams of things which thou canst neither see 
nor hear. 
Alas, the mountain- tops that look so green and fair ! 
I 've heard of feai-ful winds and darkness that come 
there ; 
The little brooks that seem all pastime and all play, 
When they are angry, roar like lions for their prey. 
Here thou need'st not dread the raven in the sky ; 
Night and day thou art safe, — our cottage is hard by. 
Why bleat so after me ? Why pull so at thy chain  
Sleep — and at break of day I will come to thee 
again !" 
— As homeward through the lane I went with lazy 
feet, 
This song to myself did I oftentimes repeat ; 
And it seemed, as I retraced the ballad line by line, 
That but half of it was hers, and one half of it was 

Again, and once again, did I repeat the song ; 
" Nay," said I, " more than half to the damsel 
must belong, 
For she looked with such a look, and she spake 
with such a tone, 
That I almost received her heart into my own."

TO H. C. 

SfX YEARS OLD. 

O thou ! whose fancies from afar are brought : 
Who of thy words dost make a mock apparel, 
And fittest to unutterable thought 
The breeze-like motion and the self-born carol 
Thou faery voyager ! that dost float 
In such clear water, that thy boat 
May rather seem 
To brood on air than on an earthly stream; 
Suspended in a stream as clear as sky, 
Where earth and heaven do make one imagery ; 
blessed vision ! happy child ! 
Thou art so exquisitely wild, 
 think of thee with many fears 
For what may be thy lot hi future years. 
I thought of times when Pain might be thy guest, 
Lord of thy house and hospitality; 
And Grief, uneasy lover ! never rest 
But when she sate within the touch of thee. 
too industrious folly ! 
vain and causeless melancholy ! 
Nature will either end thee quite; 
Or, lengthening out thy season of delight, 
Preserve for thee, by individual right, 
A young lamb's heart among the full-grown flocks. 
What hast thou to do with sorrow, 
Or the injuries of to-morrow ? 
Thou art a dew-drop, which the morn brings forth, 
 fitted to sustain unkindly shocks, 
Or to be trailed along the soiling earth; 
A gem that glitters while it fives, 
And no forewarning gives; 
But, at the touch of wrong, without a strife 
Slips in a moment out of life. 



INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS 
IN CALLING FORTH AND STRENGTHENING THE IMAGI- 
NATION IN BOYHOOD AND EARLY YOUTH. 
FROM AN UNPUBLISHED POKM. 
[This extract is reprinted from " The Friend."] 
Wisdom and Spirit of the universe ! 
Thou Soul, that art the Eternity of thought ! 
And giv'st to forms and images a breath 
And everlasting motion ! not in vain, 
By day or star-light, thus from my first dawn 

THE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD. 

 

Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me 
The passions that build up our human soul; 
Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man; 
But with high objects, with enduring things, 
With life and nature ; purifying thus 
The elements of feeling and of thought, 
And sanctifying by such discipline 
Both pain and fear, — until we recognise 
A grandeur in the beatings of the heart. 
Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me 
With stinted kindness. In November days, 
When vapours rolling down the valleys made 
A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods 
At noon ; and mid the calm of summer nights, 
When, by the margin of the trembling lake, 
Beneath the gloomy hills, homeward I went 
In solitude, such intercourse was mine : 
Mine was it in the fields both day and night, 
And by the waters, all the summer long. 
And in the frosty season, when the sun 
Was set, and, visible for many a mile, 
The cottage-windows through the twilight blazed, 
I heeded not the summons: happy time 
It was indeed for all of us; for me 
It was a time of rapture ! Clear and loud 
The village-clock tolled six — I wheeled about, 
Proud and exulting like an untired horse 
That cares not for his home. — All shod with steel 
We hissed along the polished ice, in games 
Confederate, imitative of the chase 
And woodland pleasures, — the resounding horn, 
The pack loud-chiming, and the hunted hare. 
So through the darkness and the cold we flew, 
And not a voice was idle: with the din 
Smitten, the precipices rang aloud; 
The leafless trees and every icy crag 
Tinkled like iron; while far-distant hills 
Into the tumult sent an alien sound 
Of melancholy, not unnoticed while the stars, 
Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west 
The orange sky of evening died away. 
Not seldom from the uproar I retired 
Into a silent bay, or sportively 
Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, 
To cut across the reflex of a star ; 
Image, that, flying still before me, gleamed 
Upon the glassy plain: and oftentimes, 
When we had given our bodies to the wind, 
And all the shadowy banks on either side 
Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still 
The rapid line of motion, then at once 
Have I, reclining back upon my heels, 

Stopped short ; yet still the solitary cliffs 
Wheeled by me — even as if the earth had rolled 
With visible motion her diurnal round ! 
Behind me did they stretch in solemn train, 
Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched 
Till all was tranquil as a summer sea. 
. 


XVII. 
THE LONGEST DAY. 
ADDRESSED TO MY DAUGHTER. 
Let us quit the leafy arbour, 
And the torrent murmuring by; 
For the sun is in his harbour, 
Weary of the open sky. 
Evening now unbinds the fetters 
Fashioned by the gloving light; 
All that breathe are thankful debtors 
To the harbinger of night. 
Yet by some grave thoughts attended 
Eve renews her calm career; 
For the day that now is ended, 
Is the longest of the year. 
Dora ! sport, as now thou sportest, 
On this platform, light and free; 
Take thy bliss, while longest, shortest, 
Are indifferent to thee ! 
Who would check the happy feeling 
That inspires the linnet's song ? 
Who would stop the swallow, wheeling 
On her pinions swift and strong ? 
Yet at this impressive season, 
Words which tenderness can speak 
From the truths of homely reason, 
Might exalt the loveliest cheek; 
And, while shades to shades succeeding 
Steal the landscape from the sight, 
I would urge this moral pleading, 
Last forer unn er of " Good night !" 
Summer ebbs; — each day that follows 
Is a reflux from on high, 
Tending to the darksome hollows 
Where the frosts of winter he. 

 

POEMS REFERRING TO 

He who governs the creaiiou, 
In his providence, assigned 
Such a gradual declination 
To the life of human kind. 
Yet we mark it not; — fruits redden, 
Fresh flowers blow, as flowers have blown, 
And the heart is loth to deaden 
Hopes that she so long hath known. 
Be thou wiser, youthful Maiden ! 
And when thy decline shall come, 
Let not flowers, or boughs fruit-laden, 
Hide the knowledge of thy doom. 
Now, even now, ere wrapped in slumber, 
Fix thine eyes upon the sea 
That absorbs time, space, and number ; 
Look thou to Eternity ! 
Follow thou the flowing river 
On whose breast are thither borne 
All deceived, and each deceiver, 
Through the gates of night and morn ; 
Through the year's successive portals ; 
Through the bounds which many a star 
Marks, not mindless of frail mortals, 
When his light returns from far. 
Thus when thou with Time hast travelled 
Toward the mighty gulf of things, 
And the mazy stream unravelled 
With thy best imaginings ; 
Think, if thou on beauty leanest, 
Think how pitiful that stay, 
Did not virtue give the meanest 
Charms superior to decay. 
Duty, like a strict preceptor, 
Sometimes frowns, or seems to frown ; 
Choose her thistle for thy sceptre, 
While youth's roses are thy crown. 
Grasp it, — if thou shrink and tremble, 
Fairest damsel of the green, 
Thou wilt lack the only symbol 
That proclaims a genuine queen ; 
And ensures those palms of honour 
Which selected spirits wear, 
Bending low before the Donor, 
Lord of heaven's unchanging year ! 

XVIII. 
THE NORMAN BOY. 
High on a broad unfertile tract of forest-skirted 
Down, 
Nor kept by Nature for herself, nor made by man 
his own, 
From home and company remote and every playful 
Served, tending a few sheep and goats, a ragged 
Norman Boy. 
Him never saw I, nor the spot; but from an English 
Dame, 
Stranger to me and yet my friend, a simple notice 
came, 
With suit that I would speak in vei'se of that seques- 
tered child 
Whom, one bleak winter's day, she met upon the 
dreary Wild. 
His flock, along the woodland's edge with relics 
sprinkled o'er 
Of last night's snow, beneath a sky threatening the 
fall of more, 
Where tufts of herbage tempted each, were busy at 
their feed, 
And the poor Boy was busier still, with work of 
anxious heed. 
There was he, where of branches rent and withered 
and decayed, 
For covert from the keen north wind, his hands a 
hut had made. 
A tiny tenement, forsooth, and frail, as needs must be 
A thing of such materials framed, by a builder 
such as he. 
The hut stood finished by his pains, nor seemingly 
lacked aught 
That skill or means of his could add, but the 
architect had wrought 
Some limber twigs into a Cross, well-shaped with 
fingers nice, 
To be engrafted on the top of his small edifice. 
That Cross he now was fastening there, as the surest 
power and best 
For supplying all deficiencies, all wants of the rude 
nest 
In which, from burning heat, or tempest driving 
far and wide, 
The innocent Boy, else shelterless, his lonely head 
must hide. 

THE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD. 

 

That Cross belike he also raised as a standard for 
the true 
And faithful service of his heart in the worst that 
might ensue 
Of hardship and distressful fear, amid the houseless 
waste 
Where he, in his poor self so weak, by Providence 
was placed. 
Here, Lady ! might I cease ; but nay, let us 
before we part 
With this dear holy shepherd-boy breathe a prayer 
of earnest heart, 
That unto him, where'er shall he his life's appointed 
way, 
The Cross, fixed in his soul, may prove an all- 
sufficing stay. 

XIX. 
THE POET'S DREAM, 
SEQUEL TO THE NORMAN HOY. 
Just as those final words were penned, the sun 
broke out in power, 
And gladdened all things ; but, as chanced^ within 
that very hour, 
Air blackened, thunder growled, fire flashed from 
clouds that hid the sky, 
And, for the Subject of my Verse, I heaved a 
pensive sigh. 
Nor could my heart by second thoughts from 
heaviness be cleared, 
For bodied forth before my eyes the cross-crowned 
hut appeared ; 
And, while around it storm as fierce seemed troub- 
ling earth and air, 
I saw, within, the Norman Boy kneeling alone in 
prayer. 
The Child, as if the thunder's voice spake with 
articulate call, 
Bowed meekly in submissive fear, before the Lord 
of All; 
His lips were moving ; and his eyes, upraised to 
sue for grace, 
With soft illumination cheered the dimness of that 
place. 
How beautiful is holiness ! — what wonder if the sight, 
Almost as vivid as a dream, produced a dream at 
night? 

It came with sleep and showed the Boy, no cherub, 
not transformed, 
But the poor ragged Thing whose ways my human 
heart had warmed. 
Me had the dream equipped with wings, so I took 
him in my arms, 
And lifted from the grassy floor, stilling his faint 
alarms, 
And bore him high through yielding air my debt 
of love to pay, 
By giving him, for both our sakes, an hour of 
holiday. 
I whispered, " Yet a little while, dear Child ! thou 
art my own, 
To show thee some delightful thing, in country or 
in town. 
What shall it be ? a mirthful throng ? or that holy 
place and calm 
St. Denis, filled with royal tombs, or the Church of 
Notre Dame ? 
" St. Ouen's golden Shrine ? Or choose what else 
would please thee most 
Of any wonder Normandy, or all proud France, 
can boast ! " 
" My Mother," said the Boy, " was born near to a 
blessed Tree, 
The Chapel Oak of Allonville ; good Angel, show 
it me !" 
On wings, from broad and stedfast poise let loose 
by this reply, 
For Allonville, o'er down and dale, away then did 
we fly; 
O'er town and tower we flew, and fields in May's 
fresh verdure drest ; 
The wings they did not flag; the Child, though 
grave, was not deprest. 
But who shall show, to waking sense, the gleam of 
light that broke 
Forth from his eyes, when first the Boy looked 
down on that huge oak, 
For length of days so much revered, so famous 
where it stands 
For twofold hallowing — Nature's care, and work 
of human hands ? 
Strong as an Eagle with my charge I glided round 
and round 
The wide-spread boughs, for view of door, window, 
and stair that wound 

 

POEMS REFERRING TO THE PERIOD OF CHILDHOOD. 

Gracefully up the gnarled trunk ; nor left we 
unsurveyed 
The pointed steeple peering forth from the centre 
of the shade. 
I lighted — opened with soft touch the chapel's iron 
door, 
Past softly, leading in the Boy ; and, while from 
roof to floor 
From floor to roof all round his eyes the Child 
with wonder cast, 
Pleasure on pleasure crowded in, each livelier than 
the last. 
For, deftly framed within the trunk, the sanctuary 
showed, 
By light of lamp and preci ous stones, that glimmered 
here, there glowed, 
Shrine, Altar, Image, Offerings hung in sign of 
gratitude ; 
Sight that inspired accordant thoughts ; and speech 
I thus renewed : 
"Hither the Afflicted come, as thou hast heard 
thy Mother say, 
And, kneeling, supplication make to our Lady de 
la Paix ; 
What mournful sighs have here been heard, and, 
when the voice was stopt 
By sudden pangs ; what bitter tears have on this 
pavement dropt ! 
" Poor Shepherd of the naked Down, a favoured 
lot is thine, 
Far happier lot, dear Boy, than brings full many 
to this shrine ; 
From body pains and pains of soul thou needest no 
release, 
Thy hours as they flow on are spent, if not in joy, 
in peace. 
" Then offer up thy heart to God in thankfulness 
and praise, 
Give to Him prayers, and many thoughts, in thy 
most busy days ; 
And in His sight the fragile Cross, on thy small 
hut, will be 
Holy as that which long hath crowned the Chapel 
of this Tree ; 
" Holy as that far seen which crowns the sumptuous 
Church in Rome 
Where thousands meet to worship God under a 
mighty Dome ; 

He sees the bending multitude, he hears the choral 
rites, 
Yet not the less, in children's hymns and lonely 
prayer, delights. 
" God for his service needeth not proud work of 
human skill ; 
They please him best who labour most to do in 
peace his will : 
So let us strive to live, and to our Spirits will be 
given 
Such wings as, when our Saviour calls, shall bear 
us up to heaven." 
The Boy no answer made by words, but, so earnest 
was his look, 
Sleep fled, and with it fled the dream — recorded in 
this book, 
Lest all that passed should melt away in silence 
from my mind, 
As visions still more bright have done, and left no 
trace behind. 
But oh ! that Country-man of thine, whose eye, 
loved Child, can see 
A pledge of endless bliss in acts of early piety, 
In verse, which to thy ear might come, would treat 
this simple theme, 
Nor leave untold our happy flight in that 
adventurous dream. 
Alas the dream, to thee, poor Boy ! to thee from 
whom it flowed, 
Was nothing, scarcely can be aught, yet 'twas 
bounteously bestowed, 
If I may dare to cherish hope that gentle eyes will 
read 
Not loth, and listening Little-ones, heart-touched, 
their fancies feed.

THE WESTMORELAND GIRL. 
TO MV GRANDCHILDREN. 
PART I. 
Seek who will delight in fable 
I shall tell you truth. A Lamb 
Leapt from this steep bank to follow 
'Cross the brook its thoughtless dam. 
 See note. 

THE WESTMORELAND GIRL. 

 

Far and wide on hill and valley 
Rain had fallen, unceasing rain. 
And the bleating mother's Young-one 
Struggled with the flood in vain : 
But, as chanced, a Cottage-maiden 
(Ten years scarcely had she told) 
Seeing, plunged into the torrent, 
Clasped the Lamb and kept her hold. 
Whirled adown the rocky channel, 
Sinking, rising, on they go, 
Peace and rest, as seems, before them 
Only in the lake below. 
Oh ! it was a frightful current 
Whose fierce wrath the Girl had braved 
Clap your hands with joy my Hearers, 
Shout in triumph, both are saved ; 
Saved by courage that with danger 
Grew, by strength the gift of love, 
And belike a guardian angel 
Came with succour from above. 

PART II. 
Now, to a maturer Audience, 
Let me speak of this brave Child 
Left among her native mountains 
With wild Nature to run wild. 
So, unwatched by love maternal, 
Mother's care no more her guide, 
Fared this little bright-eyed Orphan 
Even while at her father's side. 
Spare your blame, — remembrance makes him 
Loth to rule by strict command ; 
Still upon his cheek are living 
Touches of her infant hand, 
Dear caresses given in pity, 
Sympathy that soothed his grief, 
As the dying mother witnessed 
To her thankful mind's relief. 
Time passed on ; the Child was happy, 
Like a Spirit of air she moved, 
Wayward, yet by all who knew her 
For her tender heart beloved. 
Scarcely less than sacred passions, 
Bred in house, in grove, and field, 
Link her with the inferior creatures, 
Urge her powers their rights to shield. 

Anglers, bent on reckless pastime, 
Learn how she can feel alike 
Both for tiny harmless minnow 
And the fierce and sharp-toothed pike. 
Merciful protectress, kindling 
Into anger or disdain ; 
Many a captive hath she rescued, 
Others saved from lingering pain. 
Listen yet awhile; — with patience 
Hear the homely truths I tell, 
She in Grasmere's old church-steeple 
Tolled this day the passing-bell. 
Yes, the wild Girl of the mountains 
To their echoes gave the sound, 
Notice punctual as the minute, 
Warning solemn and profound. 
She, fulfilling her sire's office, 
Rang alone the far-heard kuell, 
Tribute, by her hand, in sorrow, 
Paid to One who loved her well. 
When his spirit was departed 
On that service she went forth ; 
Nor will fail the like to render 
When his corse is laid in earth. 
What then wants the Child to temper, 
In her breast, unruly fire, 
To control the froward impulse 
And restrain the vague desire ? 
Easily a pious training 
And a stedfast outward power 
Would supplant the weeds and cherish, 
In their stead, each opening flower. 
Thus the fearless Lamb-deliv'rer, 
Woman-grown, meek-hearted, sage, 
May become a blest example 
For her sex, of every age. 
Watchful as a wheeling eagle, 
Constant as a soaring lark, 
Should the country need a heroine, 
She might prove our Maid of Arc. 
Leave that thought ; and here be uttered 
Prayer that Grace divine may raise 
Her humane courageous spirit 
Up to heaven, thro' peaceful ways.

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

THE BROTHERS. 
" These Tourists, heaven preserve us ! needs must 
live 
A profitable life: some glance along, 
Rapid and gay, as if the earth were air, 
And they were butterflies to wheel about 
Long as the summer lasted : some, as wise, 
Perched on the forehead of a jutting crag, 
Pencil in hand and book upon the knee, 
Will look and scribble, scribble on and look, 
Until a man might travel twelve stout miles, 
Or reap an acre of his neighbour's corn. 
But, for that moping Son of Idleness, 
Why can he tarry yonder ? — In our church-yard 
Is neither epitaph nor monument, 
Tombstone nor name — only the turf we tread 
And a few natural graves." 
To Jane, his wife, 
Thus spake the homely Priest of Ennerdale. 
It was a July evening; and he sate 
Upon the long stone-seat beneath the eaves 
Of his old cottage, — as it chanced, that day, 
Employed in winter's work. Upon the stone 
His wife sate near him, teasing matted wool, 
While, from the twin cards toothed with glittering 
wire, 
He fed the spindle of his youngest child, 
Who, in the open air, with due accord 
Of busy hands and back-and-forward steps, 
Her large round wheel was turning. Towards the field 
In which the Parish Chapel stood alone, 
Girt round with a bare ring of mossy wall, 
While half an hour went by, the Priest had sent 
Many a long look of wonder : and at last, 
Risen from his seat, beside the snow-white ridge 
Of carded wool which the old man had piled 
He laid his implements with gentle care, 
Each in the other locked; and, down the path 
That from his cottage to the church-yard led, 
He took his way, impatient to accost 
The Stranger, whom he saw still lingering there. 
'Twas one well known to him in former days, 
A Shepherd-lad; who ere his sixteenth year 

Had left that calling, tempted to entrust 
His expectations to the fickle winds 
And perilous waters; with the mariners 
A fellow-mariner; — and so had fared 
Through twenty seasons; but he had been reared 
Among the mountains, and he in his heart 
Was half a shepherd on the stormy seas. 
Oft in the piping shrouds had Leonard heard 
The tones of waterfalls, and inland sounds 
Of caves and trees : — and, when the regular wind 
Between the tropics filled the steady sail, 
And blew with the same breath through days and 
weeks, 
Lengthening invisibly its weary line 
Along the cloudless Main, he, in those hours 
Of tiresome indolence, would often hang 
Over the vessel's side, and gaze and gaze ; 
And, while the broad blue wave and sparkling foam 
Flashed round him images and hues that wrought 
In union with the employment of his heart, 
He, thus by feverish passion overcome, 
Even with the organs of his bodily eye, 
Below him, in the bosom of the deep, 
Saw mountains; saw the forms of sheep that grazed 
On verdant hills — with dwellings among trees, 
And shepherds clad in the same country grey 
Which he himself had worn. 
And now, at last, 
From perils manifold, with some small wealth 
Acquired by traffic 'mid the Indian Isles, 
To his paternal home he is returned, 
With a determined purpose to resume 
The life he had lived there; both for the sake 
Of many darling pleasures, and the love 
Which to an only brother he has borne 
In all his hardships, since that happy time 
When, whether it blew foul or fair, they two 
Were brother-shepherds on their native hills. 
— They were the last of all their race: and now, 
When Leonard had approached his home, his heart 
Failed in him; and, not venturing to enquire 
Tidings of one so long and dearly loved, 

 This description of the Calenture is sketched from an 
imperfect recollection of an admirable one in prose, by Mr. 
Gilbert, author of the Hurricane. 

THE BROTHERS. 

 

He to the solitary church-yard turned; 
That, as he knew in what particular spot 
His family were laid, he thence might learn 
If still his Brother lived, or to the file 
Another grave was added. — He had found 
Another grave, — near which a full half-hour 
He had remained ; but, as he gazed, there grew 
Such a confusion in his memory, 
That he began to doubt; and even to hope 
That he had seen this heap of turf before, — 
That it was not another grave ; but one 
He had forgotten. He had lost his path, 
As up the vale, that afternoon, he walked 
Through fields which once had been well known to 
him : 
And oh what joy this recollection now 
Sent to his heart ! he lifted up his eyes, 
And, looking round, imagined that he saw 
Strange alteration wrought on every side 
Among the woods and fields, and that the rocks, 
And everlasting hills themselves were changed. 
By this the Priest, who down the field had come, 
Unseen by Leonard, at the church-yard gate 
Stopped short, — and thence, at leisure, limb by limb 
Perused him with a gay complacency. 
Ay, thought the Vicar, smiling to himself, 
'Tis one of those who needs must leave the path 
Of the world's business to go wild alone : 
His arms have a perpetual holiday ; 
The happy man will creep about the fields, 
Following his fancies by the hour, to bring 
Tears down his cheek, or solitary smiles 
Into his face, until the setting sun 
Write fool upon his forehead. — Planted thus 
Beneath a shed that over-arched the gate 
Of this rude church-yard, till the stars appeared 
The good Man might have communed with himself, 
But that the Stranger, who had left the grave, 
Approached ; he recognised the Priest at once, 
And, after greetings interchanged, and given 
By Leonard to the Vicar as to one 
Unknown to him, this dialogue ensued. 
Leonard. You five, Sir, in these dales, a quiet 
life: 
Your years make up one peaceful family ; 
And who would grieve and fret, if, welcome come 
And welcome gone, they are so like each other, 
They cannot be remembered ? Scarce a funeral 
Comes to this church-yard once in eighteen months; 
And yet, some changes must take place among you : 
And you, who dwell here, even among these rocks, 
Can trace the finger of mortality, 
And see, that with our threescore years and ten 

We are not all that perish.  remember, 
(For many years ago I passed this road) 
There was a foot-way all along the fields 
By the brook-side — 'tis gone — and that dark cleft ! 
To me it does not seem to wear the face 
Which then it had ! 
Priest. Nay, Sir, for aught I know, 
That chasm is much the same — 
Leonard.. But, surely, yonder — 
Priest. Ay, there, indeed, your memory is a friend 
That does not play you false. — On that tall pike 
(It is the loneliest place of all these hills) 
There were two springs which bubbled side by 
side, 
As if they had been made that they might be 
Companions for each other : the huge crag 
Was rent with lightning — one hath disappeared ; 
The other, left behind, is flowing still. 
For accidents and changes such as these, 
We want not store of them ; — a water-spout 
Will bring down half a mountain ; what a feast 
For folks that wander up and down like you, 
To see an acre's breadth of that wide cliff 
One roaring cataract ! a sharp May-storm 
Will come with loads of January snow, 
And in one night send twenty score of sheep 
To feed the ravens ; or a shepherd dies 
By some untoward death among the rocks : 
The ice breaks up and sweeps away a bridge ; 
A wood is felled : — and then for our own homes ! 
A child is born or christened, a field ploughed, 
A daughter sent to service, a web spun, 
The old house-clock is decked with a new face ; 
And hence, so far from wanting facts or dates 
To chronicle the time, we all have here 
A pair of diaries, — one serving, Sir, 
For the whole dale, and one for each fire-side — 
Yours was a stranger's judgment : for historians, 
Commend me to these valleys ! 
Leonard. Yet your Church-yard 
Seems, if such freedom may be used with you, 
To say that you are heedless of the past : 
An orphan could not find his mother's grave : 
Here 's neither head nor foot-stone, plate of brass, 
Cross-bones nor skull, — type of our earthly state 
Nor emblem of our hopes : the dead man's home 
Ts but a fellow to that pasture-field. 
Priest. Why, there, Sir, is a thought that 's new 
to me ! 
The stone-cutters, 'tis true, might beg their bread 
If every English church-yard were like ours ; 
Yet your conclusion wanders from the truth : 
We have no need of names and epitaphs ; 
We talk about the dead by our fire-sides. 

 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

And then, for our immortal part ! we want 
No symbols, Sir, to tell us that plain tale : 
The thought of death sits easy on the man 
Who has been born and dies among the mountains. 
Leonard. Your Dalesmen, then, do in each other's 
thoughts 
Possess a kind of second life : no doubt 
You, Sir, could help me to the history 
Of half these graves  
Priest. For eight-score winters past, 
With what I 've witnessed, and with what I 've 
heard, 
Perhaps I might ; and, on a winter-evening, 
If you were seated at my chimney's nook, 
By turning o'er these hillocks one by one, 
We two could travel, Sir, through a strange round ; 
Yet all in the broad highway of the world. 
Now there 's a grave — your foot is half upon it, — 
It looks just like the rest ; and yet that man 
Died broken-hearted. 
Leonard. 'Tis a common case. 
We ' take another : who is he that lies 
Beneath yon ridge, the last of those three graves ? 
It touches on that piece of native rock 
Left in the church-yard wall. 
Priest. That 's Walter Ewbank. 
He had as white a head and fresh a cheek 
As ever were produced by youth and age 
Engendering in the blood of hale fourscore. 
Through five long generations had the heart 
Of Walter's forefathers o'erfiowed the bounds 
Of their inheritance, that single cottage — 
You see it yonder ! and those few green fields. 
They toiled and wrought, and still, from sire to 
son, 
Each struggled, and each yielded as before 
A little — yet a little, — and old Walter, 
They left to him the family heart, and land 
With other burthens than the crop it bore. 
Year after year the old man still kept up 
A cheerful mind, — and buffeted with bond, 
Interest, and mortgages ; at last he sank, 
And went into his grave before his time. 
Poor Walter ! whether it was care that spurred 
him 
God only knows, but to the very last 
He had the lightest foot in Ennerdale : 
His pace was never that of an old man : 
I almost see him tripping down the path 
With his two grandsons after him : — but you, 
Unless our Landlord be your host to-night, 
Have far to travel, — and on these rough paths 
Even in the longest day of midsummer — 
Leonard. But those two Orphans ! 

Priest. Orphans ! — Such they were- 
Yet not while Walter lived : — for, though their 
parents 
Lay buried side by side as now they lie, 
The old man was a father to the boys, 
Two fathers in one father : and if tears, 
Shed when he talked of them where they were not, 
And hauntings from the infirmity of love, 
Are aught of what makes up a mother's heart, 
This old Man, in the day of his old age, 
Was half a mother to them. — If you weep, Sir, 
To hear a stranger talking about strangers, 
Heaven bless you when you are among your 
kindred ! 
Ay — you may turn that way — it is a grave 
Which will bear looking at. 
Leonard. These boys — I hope 
They loved this good old Man  — 
Priest. They did — and truly : 
But that was what we almost overlooked, 
They were such darlings of each other. Yes, 
Though from the cradle they had lived with 
Walter, 
The only kinsman near them, and though he 
Inclined to both by reason of his age, 
With a more fond, familiar, tenderness ; 
They, notwithstanding, had much love to spare, 
And it all went into each other's hearts. 
Leonard, the elder by just eighteen months, 
Was two years taller : 'twas a joy to see, 
To hear, to meet them ! — From their house the 
school 
Is distant three short miles, and in the time 
Of storm and thaw, when every water-course 
And unbridged stream, such as you may have 
noticed 
Crossing our roads at every hundred steps, 
Was swoln into a noisy rivulet, 
Would Leonard then, when elder boys remained 
At home, go staggering through the slippery fords, 
Bearing his brother on his back. I have seen him, 
On windy days, in one of those stray brooks, 
Ay, more than once I have seen him, mid-leg deep, 
Their two books lying both on a dry stone, 
Upon the hither side : and once I said, 
As I remember, looking round these rocks 
And hills on which we all of us were bora, 
That God who made the great book of the world 
Would bless such piety — 
Leonard. It may be then — 
Priest. Never did worthier lads break English 
bread ; 
The very brightest Sunday Autumn saw 
With all its mealy clusters of ripe nuts, 

THE BROTHERS. 

 

Could never keep those boys away from church, 
Or tempt them to an hour of sabbath breach. 
Leonard and James ! I warrant, every comer 
Among these rocks, and every hollow place 
That venturous foot could reach, to one or both 
Was known as well as to the flowers that grow 
there. 
Like roe-bucks they went bounding o'er the hills ; 
They played like two young ravens on the crags : 
Then they could write, ay and speak too, as well 
As many of their betters — and for Leonard ! 
The very night before be went away, 
In my own house I put into his hand 
A bible, and I 'd wager house and field 
That, if he be alive, he has it yet. 
Leonard. It seems, these Brothers have not lived 
to be 
A comfort to each other — 
Priest. That they might 
Live to such end is what both old and young 
In this our valley all of us have wished, 
And what, for my part, I have often prayed : 
But Leonard — 
Leonard. Then James still is left among you ! 
Priest. 'Tis of the elder brother I am speaking : 
They had an uncle; — he was at that time 
A thriving man, and trafficked on the seas: 
And, but for that same uncle, to this hour 
Leonard had never handled rope or shroud: 
For the boy loved the life which we lead here; 
And though of unripe years, a stripling only, 
His soul was knit to this his native soil. 
But, as I said, old Walter was too weak 
To strive with such a torrent; when he died, 
The estate and house were sold; and all their sheep, 
A pretty flock, and which, for aught I know, 
Had clothed the Ewbanks for a thousand years : — 
Well — all was gone, and they were destitute, 
And Leonard, chiefly for his Brother's sake, 
Resolved to try his fortune on the seas. 
Twelve years are past since we had tidings from him. 
If there were one among us who had heard 
That Leonard Ewbank was come home again, 
From the Great Gavel , down by Leeza's banks, 
And down the Enna, far as Egremont, 
The day would be a joyous festival ; 

 The Great Gavel, so called, I imagine, from its resem- 
blance to the gable end of a house, is one of the highest of 
the Cumberland mountains. It stands at the head of the 
several vales of Ennerdale, Wastdale, and Borrowdale. 
The Leeza is a river which flows into the Lake of Enner- 
dale : on issuing from the Lake, it changes its name, and 
is called the End, Eyne, or Enna. It falls into the sea a 
little below Egremont. 

And those two bells of ours, which there you see — 
Hanging in the open air — but, good Sir ! 
This is sad talk — they ' never sound for him — 
Living or dead. — When last we heard of him, 
He was in slavery among the Moors 
Upon the Barbary coast. — 'Twas not a little 
That would bring down his spirit ; and no doubt, 
Before it ended in his death, the Youth 
Was sadly crossed. — Poor Leonard ! when we 
parted, 
He took me by the hand, and said to me, 
If e'er he should grow rich, he would return, 
To live in peace upon his father's land, 
And lay his bones among us. 
Leonard. If that day 
Should come, 't would needs be a glad day for him ; 
He would himself, no doubt, be happy then 
As any that should meet him — ■ 
Priest. Happy ! Sir — 
Leonard. You said his kindred all were in their 
graves, 
And that he had one Brother — 
Priest. That is but 
A fellow-tale of sorrow. From his youth 
James, though not sickly, yet was delicate ; 
And Leonard being always by his side 
Had done so many offices about him, 
That, though he was not of a timid nature, 
Yet still the spirit of a mountain-boy 
In him was somewhat checked; and, when his 
Brother 
Was gone to sea, and he was left alone, 
The little colour that he had was soon 
Stolen from his cheek ; he drooped, and pined, and 
pined — 
Leonard. But these are all the graves of full- 
grown men ! 
Priest. Ay, Sir, that passed away : we took him 
to us ; 
He was the cliild of all the dale — he lived 
Three months with one, and six months with another ; 
And wanted neither food, nor clothes, nor love : 
And many, many happy days were his. 
But, whether blithe or sad, 'tis my belief 
His absent Brother still was at his heart. 
And, when he dwelt beneath our roof, we found 
(A practice till this time unknown to him) 
That often, rising from his bed at night, 
He in his sleep would walk about, and sleeping 
He sought his brother Leonard. — You are moved! 
Forgive me, Sir : before I spoke to you, 
I judged you most unkindly. 
Leonard. But this Youth, 
How did he die at last ? 

 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

Priest. One sweet May-morning, 
(It will be twelve years since when Spring returns) 
He had gone forth among the new-dropped lambs, 
With two or three companions, whom their course 
Of occupation led from height to height 
Under a cloudless sun — till he, at length, 
Through weariness, or, haply, to indulge 
The humour of the moment, lagged behind. 
You see yon precipice ; — it wears the shape 
Of a vast building made of many crags ; 
And in the midst is one particular rock 
That rises like a column from the vale, 
Whence by our shepherds it is called, The Pillar. 
Upon its aery summit crowned with heath, 
The loiterer, not unnoticed by his comrades, 
Lay stretched at ease ; but, passing by the place 
On their return, they found that he was gone. 
No ill was feared ; till one of them by chance 
Entering, when evening was far spent, the house 
Which at that time was James's home, there learned 
That nobody had seen him all that day : 
The morning came, and still he was unheard of : 
The neighbours were alarmed, and to the brook 
Some hastened ; some ran to the lake : ere noon 
They found him at the foot of that same rock 
Dead, and with mangled limbs. The third day after 
I buried him, poor Youth, and there he lies ! 
Leonard. And that then is his grave ! — Before 
his death 
You say that he saw many happy years ? 
Priest. Ay, that he did — 
Leonard. And all went well with him ? — 
Priest. If he had one, the youth had twenty homes. 
Leonard. And you believe, then, that his mind 
was easy ? — 
Priest. Yes, long before he died, he found that 
time 
Is a true friend to sorrow ; and unless 
His thoughts were turned on Leonard's luckless 
fortune, 
He talked about him with a cheerful love. 
Leonard. He could not come to an unhallowed 
end ! 
Priest. Nay, God forbid !— You recollect I 
mentioned 
A habit which disquietude and grief 
Had brought upon him ; and we all conjectured 
That, as the day was warm, he had lain down 
On the soft heath, — and, waiting for his comrades, 
He there had fallen asleep ; that in his sleep 
He to the margin of the precipice 
Had walked, and from the summit had fallen 
headlong : 
And so no doubt he perished. When the Youth 

Fell, in his hand he must have grasp'd, we think, 
His shepherd's staff ; for on that Pillar of rock 
It had been caught mid way ; and there for years 
It hung ; — and mouldered there. 
The Priest here ended — 
The Stranger would have thanked him, but he felt 
A gushing from his heart, that took away 
The power of speech. Both left the spot in silence ; 
And Leonard, when they reached the church-yard 
gate, 
As the Priest lifted up the latch, turned round, — 
And, looking at the grave, he said, " My Brother !" 
The Vicar did not hear the words : and now, 
He pointed towards his dwelling-place, entreating 
That Leonard would partake his homely fare : 
The other thanked him with an earnest voice ; 
But added, that, the evening being calm, 
He would pursue his journey. So they parted. 
It was not long ere Leonard reached a grove 
That overhung the road : he there stopped short, 
And, sitting down beneath the trees, reviewed 
All that the Priest had said : his early years 
Were with him : — his long absence, cherished hopes, 
And thoughts which had been his an hour before, 
All pressed on him with such a weight, that now, 
This vale, where he had been so happy, seemed 
A place in which he could not bear to live : 
So he relinquished all his purposes. 
He travelled back to Egremont : and thence, 
That night, he wrote a letter to the Priest, 
Reminding him of what had passed between them ; 
And adding, with a hope to be forgiven, 
That it was from the weakness of his heart 
He had not dared to tell him who he was. 
This done, he went on shipboard, and is now 
A Seaman, a grey-headed Mariner. 
. 

ARTEGAL AND ELIDURE. 
(see the chronicle of geoffrey of monmouth and 
milton's history of England ) 
Where be the temples which, in Britain's Isle, 
For his paternal Gods, the Trojan raised ? 
Gone like a morning dream, or like a pile 
Of clouds that in cerulean ether blazed ! 
Ere Julius landed on her white-cliffed shore, 
They sank, delivered o'er 
To fatal dissolution ; and, I ween, 
No vestige then was left that such had ever been. 

ARTEGAL AND ELIDURE. 

Nathless, a British record (long concealed 
In old Armorica, whose secret springs 
No Gothic conqueror ever drank) revealed 
The marvellous current of forgotten things ; 
How Brutus came, by oracles impelled, 
And Albion's giants quelled, 
A brood whom no civility could melt, 
' Who never tasted grace, and goodness ne'er had 
felt.' 
By brave Corineus aided, he subdued, 
And rooted out the intolerable kind ; 
And this too-long-polluted land imbued 
With goodly arts and usages refined ; 
Whence golden harvests, cities, warlike towers, 
And pleasure's sumptuous bowers ; 
Whence all the fixed delights of house and home, 
Friendships that will not break, and love that can- 
not roam. 
O, happy Britain ! region all too fair 
For self-delighting fancy to endure 
That silence only should inhabit there, 
Wild beasts, or uncouth savages impure ! 
But, intermingled with the generous seed, 
Grew many a poisonous weed ; 
Thus fares it still with all that takes its birth 
From human care, or grows upon the breast of earth. 
Hence, and how soon ! that war of vengeance waged 
By Guendolen against her faithless lord ; 
Till she, in jealous fury unassuaged 
Had slain his paramour with ruthless sword : 
Then, into Severn hideously defiled, 
She flung her blameless child, 
Sabrina, — vowing that the stream should bear 
That name through every age, her hatred to declare. 
So speaks the Chronicle, and tells of Lear 
By his ungrateful daughters turned adrift. 
Ye lightnings, hear his voice !— they cannot hear, 
Nor can the winds restore his simple gift. 
But One there is, a Child of nature meek, 
Who comes her Sire to seek ; 
And he, recovering sense, upon her breast 
Leans smilingly, and sinks into a perfect rest. 
There too we read of Spenser's fairy themes, 
And those that Milton loved in youthful years ; 
The sage enchanter Merlin's subtle schemes ; 
The feats of Arthur and his knightly peers ; 
Of Arthur, — who, to upper light restored, 
With that terrific sword 
Which yet he brandishes for future war, 
Shall lift his country's fame above the polar star ! 

What wonder, then, if in such ample field 
Of old tradition, one particular flower 
Doth seemingly in vain its fragrance yield, 
And bloom unnoticed even to this late hour ? 
Now, gentle Muses, your assistance grant, 
While I this flower transplant 
Into a garden stored with Poesy ; 
Where flowers and herbs unite, and haply some 
weeds be, 
That, wanting not wild grace, are from all mischief 
free ! 
A King more worthy of respect and love 
Than wise Gorbonian ruled not in his day ; 
And grateful Britain prospered far above 
All neighbouring countries through his righteous 
sway; 
He poured rewards and honours on the good ; 
The oppressor he withstood ; 
And while he served the Gods with reverence clue 
Fields smiled, and temples rose, and towns and 
cities grew. 
He died, whom Artegal succeeds — his son ; 
But how unworthy of that sire was he ! 
A hopeful reign, auspiciously begun, 
Was darkened soon by foul iniquity. 
From crime to crime he mounted, till at length 
The nobles leagued their strength 
With a vexed people, and the tyrant chased ; 
And, on the vacant throne, his worthier Brother 
placed. 
From realm to realm the humbled Exile went, 
Suppliant for aid his kingdom to regain ; 
In many a court, and many a warrior's tent, 
He urged his persevering suit in vain. 
Him, in whose wretched heart ambition failed, 
Dire poverty assailed ; 
And, tired with slights his pride no more could 
brook, 
He towards his native country cast a longing look. 
Fair blew the wished-for wind — the voyage sped ; 
He landed ; and, by many dangers scared, 
' Poorly provided, poorly followed,' 
To Calaterium's forest he repaired. 
How changed from him who, born to highest place, 
Had swayed the royal mace, 
Flattered and feared, despised yet deified, 
In Troynovant, his seat by silver Thames's side ! 
From that wild region where the crownless King 
Lay in concealment with his scanty train, 

 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

Supporting life by water from the spring, 
And such chance food as outlaws can obtain, 
Unto the few whom he esteems his friends 
A messenger he sends ; 
And from their secret loyalty requires 
Shelter and daily bread, — the sum of his desires. 
While he the issue waits, at early morn 
Wandering by stealth abroad, he chanced to hear 
A startling outcry made by hound and horn, 
From which the tusky wild boar flies in fear ; 
And, scouring toward him o'er the grassy plain, 
Behold the hunter train ! 
He bids his little company advance 
With seeming unconcern and steady countenance. 
The royal Elidure, who leads the chase, 
Hath checked his foaming courser : — can it be ! 
Methinks that I should recognise that face, 
Though much disguised by long adversity ! 
He gazed rejoicing, and again he gazed, 
Confounded and amazed — 
K It is the king, my brother ! " and, by sound 
Of his own voice confirmed, he leaps upon the 
ground. 
Long, strict, and tender was the embrace he gave, 
Feebly returned by daunted Artegal ; 
Whose natural affection doubts enslave, 
And apprehensions dark and criminal. 
Loth to restrain the moving interview, 
The attendant lords withdrew ; 
And, while they stood upon the plain apart, 
Thus Elidure, by words, relieved his struggling 
heart. 
a By heavenly Powers conducted, we have met ; 
— Brother ! to my knowledge lost so long, 
But neither lost to love, nor to regret, 
Nor to my wishes lost ; — forgive the wrong, 
(Such it may seem) if I thy crown have borne, 
Thy royal mantle worn : 
I was their natural guardian ; and 'tis just 
That now I should restore what hath been held in 
trust." 
A while the astonished Artegal stood mute, 
Then thus exclaimed : " To me, of titles shorn, 
And stripped of power ! me, feeble, destitute, 
j To me a kingdom ! spare the bitter scorn : 
If justice ruled the breast of foreign kings, 
Then, on the wide-spread wings 
Of war, had I returned to claim my right ; 
This will I here avow, not dreading thy despite." 

" I do not blame thee," Elidure replied ; 
" But, if my looks did with my words agree, 
I should at once be trusted, not defied, 
And thou from all disquietude be free. 
May the unsullied Goddess of the chase, 
Who to this blessed place 
At this blest moment led me, if I speak 
With insincere intent, on me her vengeance wreak? 
Were this same spear, which in my hand I grasp, 
The British sceptre, here would I to thee 
The symbol yield ; and would undo this clasp, 
If it confined the robe of sovereignty. 
Odious to me the pomp of regal court. 
And joyless sylvan sport, 
While thou art roving, wretched and forlorn, 
Thy coueh the dewy earth, thy roof the forest 
thorn !" 
Then Artegal thus spake : " I only sought, 
Within this realm a place of safe retreat ; 
Beware of rousing an ambitious thought ; 
Beware of kindling hopes, for me unmeet ! 
Thou art reputed wise, but in my mind 
Art pitiably blind : 
Full soon this generous purpose thou may'st rue, 
When that which has been done no wishes can undo. 
Who, when a crown is fixed upon his head, 
Would balance claim with claim, and right with 
right ? 
But thou — I know not how inspired, how led — 
Wouldst change the course of things in all men's 
sight ! 
And this for one who cannot imitate 
Thy virtue, who may hate : 
For, if, by such strange sacrifice restored, 
He reign, thou still must be his king, and sovereign 
lord; 
Lifted in magnanimity above 
Aught that my feeble nature could perform, 
Or even conceive ; surpassing me in love 
Far as in power the eagle doth the worm : 
I, Brother ! only should be king in name, 
And govern to my shame ; 
A shadow in a hated land, while all 
Of glad or willing service to thy share would fall." 
" Believe it not," said Elidure ; "respect 
Awaits on virtuous life, and ever most 
Attends on goodness with dominion decked, 
Which stands the universal empire's boast ; 
This can thy own experience testify : 
Nor shall thy foes deny 

ARTEGAL AND ELIDURE. 

 

That, in the gracious opening of thy reign, 
Our father's spirit seemed in thee to breathe again. 
And what if o'er that bright unbosoming 
Clouds of disgrace and envious fortune past ! 
Have we not seen the glories of the spring 
By veil of noontide darkness overcast ? 
The frith that glittered like a warrior's shield, 
The sky, the gay green field, 
Are vanished ; gladness ceases in the groves, 
And trepidation strikes the blackened mountain- 
coves. 
But is that gloom dissolved ? how passing clear 
Seems the wide world, far brighter than before ! 
Even so thy latent worth will re-appear, 
Gladdening the people's heart from shore to shore; 
For youthful faults ripe virtues shall atone ; 
Re-seated on thy throne, 
Proof shalt thou furnish that misfortune, pain, 
And sorrow, have confirmed thy native right to 
reign. 
But, not to overlook what thou may'st know, 
Thy enemies are neither weak nor few ; 
And circumspect must be our course, and slow, 
Or from my purpose ruin may ensue. 
Dismiss thy followers ; — let them calmly wait 
Such change in thy estate 
As I already have in thought devised ; 
And which, with caution due, may soon be realised." 
The Story tells what courses were pursued, 
Until king Elidure, with full consent 
Of all his peers, before the multitude, 
Rose, — and, to consummate this just intent, 
Did place upon his brother's head the crown, 
Relinquished by his own ; 
Then to his people cried, " Receive your lord, 
Gorbonian's first-born son, your rightful king 
restored ! " 
The people answered with a loud acclaim : 
Yet more ; — heart-smitten by the heroic deed, 
The reinstated Artegal became 
Earth's noblest penitent ; from bondage freed 
Of vice— thenceforth unable to subvert 
Or shake his high desert. 
Long did he reign ; and, when he died, the tear 
Of universal grief bedewed his honoured bier. 
Thus was a Brother by a Brother saved ; 
With whom a crown (temptation that hath set 
Discord in hearts of men till they have braved 
Their nearest kin with deadly purpose met) 

'Gainst duty weighed, and faithful love, did seem 
A thing of no esteem ; 
And, from this triumph of affection pure, 
He bore the lasting name of " pious Elidure ! " 
. 

TO A BUTTERFLY. 
I 've watch'd you now a full half-hour, 
Self-poised upon that yellow flower ; 
And, little Butterfly ! indeed 
I know not if you sleep or feed. 
How motionless ! — not frozen seas 
More motionless ! and then 
What joy awaits you, when the breeze 
Hath found you out among the trees, 
And calls you forth again ! 
This plot of orchard-ground is ours ; 
My trees they are, my Sister's flowers ; 
Here rest your wings when they are weary : 
Here lodge as in a sanctuary ! 
Come often to us, fear no wrong ; 
Sit near us on the bough ! 
We ' talk of sunshine and of song, 
And summer days, when we were young ; 
Sweet childish days, that were as long 
As twenty days are now. 
. 

A FAREWELL. 

Farewell, thou little Nook of mountain-ground, 
Thou rocky corner in the lowest stair 
Of that magnificent temple which doth bound 
One side of our whole vale with grandeur rare ; 
Sweet garden-orchard, eminently fair, 
The loveliest spot that man hath ever found, 
Farewell! — we leave thee to Heaven's peaceful care, 
Thee, and the Cottage which thou dost surround. 
Our boat is safely anchored by the shore, 
And there will safely ride when we are gone ; 
The flowering shrubs that deck our humble door 
Will prosper, though untended and alone : 
Fields, goods, and far-off chattels we have none : 
These narrow bounds contain our private store 
Of things earth makes, and sun doth shine upon ; 
Here are they in our sight — we have no more. 

 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

Sunshine and shower be with you, bud and bell ! 
For two months now in vain we shall be sought ; 
We leave you here in solitude to dwell 
With these our latest gifts of tender thought ; 
Thou, like the morning, in thy saffron coat, 
Bright gowan, and marsh-marigold, farewell ! 
Whom from the borders of the Lake we brought, 
And placed together near our rocky Well. 
We go for One to whom ye will be dear ; 
And she will prize this Bower, this Indian shed, 
Our own contrivance, Building without peer ! 
— A gentle Maid, whose heart is lowly bred, 
Whose pleasures are in wild fields gathered, 
With joyousness, and with a thoughtful cheer, 
Will come to you ; to you herself will wed ; 
And love the blessed life that we lead here. 
Dear Spot ! which we have watched' with tender heed, 
Bringing thee chosen plants and blossoms blown 
Among the distant mountains, flower and weed, 
Which thou hast taken to thee as thy own, 
Making all kindness registered and known ; 
Thou for our sakes, though Nature's child indeed, 
Fair in thyself and beautiful alone, 
Hast taken gifts which thou dost little need. 
And O most constant, yet most fickle Place, 
That hast thy wayward moods, as thou dost show 
To them who look not daily on thy face ; 
Who, being loved, in love no bounds dost know, 
And say'st, when we forsake thee, " Let them go ! " 
Thou easy-hearted Thing, with thy wild race 
Of weeds and flowers, till we return be slow, 
And travel with the year at a soft pace. 
Help us to tell Her tales of years gone by, 
And this sweet spring, the best beloved and best ; 
Joy will be flown in its mortality ; 
Something must stay to tell us of the rest. 
Here, thronged with primroses, the steep rock's 
breast 
Glittered at evening like a starry sky ; 
And in this bush our sparrow built her nest, 
Of which I sang one song that will not die 
happy Garden ! whose seclusion deep 
Hath been so friendly to industrious hours ; 
And to soft slumbers, that did gently steep 
Our spirits, carrying with them dreams of flowers, 
And wild notes warbled among leafy bowers ; 
Two burning months let summer overleap, 
And, coming back with Her who will be ours, 
Into thy bosom we again shall creep. I(i. 

STANZAS 
WRITTEN IN MY POCKET-COPY OF THOMSON'S CASTLE OF 
INDOLENCE. 
Within our happy Castle there dwelt One 
Whom without blame I may not overlook ; 
For never sun on living creature shone 
Who more devout enjoyment with us took : 
Here on his hours he hung as on a book, 
On his own time here would he float away, 
As doth a fly upon a summer brook ; 
But go to-morrow, or belike to-day, 
Seek for him, — he is fled ; and whither none can 
say. 
Thus often would he leave our peaceful home, 
And find elsewhere his business or delight ; 
Out of our Valley's limits did he roam : 
Full many a time, upon a stormy night, 
His voice came to us from the neighbouring height : 
Oft could we see him driving full in view 
At mid-day when the sun was shining bright ; 
What ill was on him, what he had to do, 
A mighty wonder bred among our quiet crew. 
Ah ! piteous sight it was to see this Man 
When he came back to us, a withered flower, — 
Or like a sinful creature, pale and wan. 
Down would he sit ; and without strength or power 
Look at the common grass from hour to hour : 
And oftentimes, how long I fear to say, 
Where apple-trees in blossom made a bower, 
Retired in that sunshiny shade he lay ; 
And, like a naked Indian, slept himself away. 
Great wonder to our gentle tribe it was 
Whenever from our Valley he withdrew ; 
For happier soul no living creature has 
Than he had, being here the long day through. 
Some thought he was a lover, and did woo : 
Some thought far worse of him, and judged him 
wrong; 
But verse was what he had been wedded to ; 
And his own mind did like a tempest strong 
Come to him thus, and drove the weary Wight 
along. 
With him there often walked in friendly guise, 
Or lay upon the moss by brook or tree, 
A noticeable Man with large grey eyes, 
And a pale face that seemed undoubtedly 
As if a blooming face it ought to be ;

Heavy Ms low-hung Up did oft appear, 
Deprest by weight of musing Phantasy ; 
Profound his forehead was, though not severe ; 
Yet some did think that he had httle business here : 
Sweet heaven forefend ! his was a lawful right ; 
Noisy he was, and gamesome as a boy; 
His limbs would toss about him with delight 
Like branches when strong winds the trees annoy. 
Nor lacked his calmer hours device or toy 
To banish listlessness and irksome care ; 
He would have taught you how you might employ 
Yourself ; and many did to him repair, — 
And certes not in vain ; he had inventions rare. 
Expedients, too, of simplest sort he tried : 
Long blades of grass, plucked round him as he lay, 
Made, to his ear attentively applied, 
A pipe on which the wind would deftly play ; 
Glasses he had, that httle things display, 
The beetle panoplied in gems and gold, 
A mailed angel on a battle-day ; 
The mysteries that cups of flowers enfold, 
And all the gorgeous sights which fames do behold. 
He would entice that other Man to hear 
His music, and to view his imagery : 
And, sooth, these two were each to the other dear : 
No livelier love in such a place could be : 
There did they dwell — from earthly labour free, 
As happy spirits as were ever seen ; 
If but a bird, to keep them company, 
Or butterfly sate down, they were, I ween, 
As pleased as if the same had been a Maiden-queen.

LOUISA. 
AFTER ACCOMPANYING HER ON A MOUNTAIN EXCURSION. 
I met Louisa in the shade, 
And, having seen that lovely Maid, 
Why should I fear to say 
That, nymph-like, she is fleet and strong, 
And down the rocks can leap along 
Like rivulets in May ? 
She loves her fire, her cottage-home ; 
Yet o'er the moorland will she roam 
In weather rough and bleak ; 
And, when against the wind she strains, 
Oh ! might I kiss the mountain rains 
That sparkle on her cheek. 

Take aU that 's mine ' beneath the moon,' 
If I with her but half a noon 
May sit beneath the walls 
Of some old cave, or mossy nook, 
When up she winds along the brook 
To hunt the waterfalls. 
. 

Strange fits of passion have  known : 
And I will dare to tell, 
But in the Lover's ear alone, 
What once to me befel. 
When she I loved looked every day 
Fresh as a rose in June, 
I to her cottage bent my way, 
Beneath an evening-moon. 
Upon the moon I fixed my eye, 
All over the wide lea ; 
With quickening pace my horse drew nigh 
Those paths so dear to me. 
And now we reached the orchard-plot ; 
And, as we climbed the hill, 
The sinking moon to Lucy's cot 
Came near, and nearer still. 
In one of those sweet dreams I slept, 
Kind Nature's gentlest boon ! 
And all the while my eyes I kept 
On the descending moon. 
My horse moved on ; hoof after hoof 
He raised, and never stopped : 
When down behind the cottage roof, 
At once, the bright moon dropped,, 
What fond and wayward thoughts will slide 
Into a Lover's head ! 
" mercy ! " to myself I cried, 
" If Lucy should be dead ! " 
. 

She dwelt among the untrodden ways 
Beside the springs of Dove, 
A Maid whom there were none to praise 
And very few to love :

Half hidden from the eye !

A second time ; for still I seem 

Her sweets, and triumph o'er the breathing rose ? 

To love thee more and more. 

Not even an hour ! 

Among thy mountains did I feel 
The joy of my desire ; 
And she I cherished turned her wheel

The happiest lovers Arcady might boast, 


Could not the entrance of this thought forbid : 

Beside an English fire.

Their branches in mid air. 

And wish as if my heart would burst. 

The humblest rivulet will take 

weary struggle ! silent years 

Its own wild liberties ; 

Tell seemingly no doubtful tale ; 

And, every day, the imprisoned lake 

And yet they leave it short, and fears 

Is flowing in the breeze. 

And hopes are strong and will prevail.

My calmest faith escapes not pain ; 
And, feeling that the hope is vain, 
I think that he will come again. 

Tis said, that some have died for love : 
And here and there a church-yard grave is found 
In the cold north's unhallowed ground, 
Because the wretched man himself had slain, 
His love was such a grievous pain. 
And there is one whom I five years have known ; 
He dwells alone 
Upon Helvellyn's side : 
He loved — the pretty Barbara died ; 
And thus he makes his moan : 
Three years had Barbara in her grave been laid 
When thus his moan he made : 
" Oh, move, thou Cottage, from behind that oak ! 
Or let the aged tree uprooted he, 
That in some other way yon smoke 
May mount into the sky ! 
The clouds pass on ; they from the heavens depart: 
I look — the sky is empty space ; 
I know not what I trace ; 
But when I cease to look, my hand is on my heart. 
! what a weight is in these shades ! Ye leaves, 
That murmur once so dear, when will it cease ? 
Your sound my heart of rest bereaves, 
It robs my heart of peace. 
Thou Thrush, that singest loud — and loud and free, 
Into yon row of willows flit, 
Upon that alder sit ; 
Or sing another song, or choose another tree. 
Roll back, sweet Rill ! back to thy mountain-bounds, 
And there for ever be thy waters chained ! 
For thou dost haunt the air with sounds 
That cannot be sustained ; 
If still beneath that pine-tree's ragged bough 
Headlong yon waterfall must come, 
Oh let it then be dumb ! 
Be anything, sweet Rill, but thatwhich thou artnow. 
Thou Eglantine, so bright with sunny showers, 
Proud as a rainbow spanning half the vale, 
Thou one fair shrub, oh ! shed thy flowers, 
And stir not in the gale. 

For thus to see thee nodding in the air, 
To see thy arch thus stretch and bend, 
Thus rise and thus descend, — ■ 
Disturbs me till the sight is more than I can bear. 
The Man who makes this feverish complaint 
Is one of giant stature, who could dance 
Equipped from head to foot in iron mail. 
Ah gentle Love ! if ever thought was thine 
To store up kindred hours for me, thy face 
Turn from me, gentle Love ! nor let me walk 
Within the sound of Emma's voice, nor know 
Such happiness as I have known to-day.

A COMPLAINT. 

There is a change — and I am poor ; 
Your love hath been, nor long ago, 
A fountain at my fond heart's door, 
Whose only business was to flow ; 
And flow it did ; not taking heed 
Of its own bounty, or my need. 
What happy moments did I count ! 
Blest was I then all bliss above ! 
Now, for that consecrated fount 
Of murmuring, sparkling, living love, 
What have I ? shall I dare to tell ? 
A comfortless and hidden well. 
A well of love — it may be deep — 
I trust it is, — and never dry : 
What matter ? if the waters sleep 
In silence and obscurity. 
— Such change, and at the very door 
Of my fond heart, hath made me poor. 

TO 
Let other bards of angels sing, 
Bright suns without a spot ; 
But thou art no such perfect thing 
Rejoice that thou art not ! 

 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

Heed not tho' none should call thee fair ; 
So, Mary, let it be 
If nought in loveliness compare 
With what thou art to me. 
True beauty dwells in deep retreats, 
Whose veil is unremoved 
Till heart with heart in concord beats ? 
And the lover is beloved. 

Yes ! thou art fair, yet be not moved 
To scorn the declaration, 
That sometimes I in thee have loved 
My fancy's own creation. 
Imagination needs must stir ; 
Dear Maid, this truth believe, 
Minds that have nothing to confer 
Find little to perceive. 
Be pleased that nature made thee fit 
To feed my heart's devotion, 
By laws to which all Forms submit 
In sky, ah', earth, and ocean. 

How rich that forehead's calm expanse ! 
How bright that heaven-directed glance ! 
— Waft her to glory, winged Powers, 
Ere sorrow be renewed, 
And intercourse with mortal hours 
Bring back a humbler mood ! 
So looked Cecilia when she drew 
An Angel from his station ; 
So looked ; not ceasing to pursue 
Her tuneful adoration ! 
But hand and voice alike are still ; 
No sound here sweeps away the will 
That gave it birth : in service meek 
One upright arm sustains the cheek, 
And one across the bosom lies — 
That rose, and now forgets to rise, 
Subdued by breathless harmonies 
Of meditative feeling ; 
Mute strains from worlds beyond the skies, 
Through the pure light of female eyes, 
Their sanctity revealing ! 
. 

What heavenly smiles ! Lady mine 
Through my very heart they shine ; 
And, if my brow gives back their light, 
Do thou look gladly on the sight ; 
As the clear Moon with modest pride 
Beholds her own bright beams 
Reflected from the mountain's side 
And from the headlong streams. 

TO 

dearer far than light and life are dear, 
Full oft our human foresight I deplore ; 
Trembling, through my unworthiness, with fear 
That friends, by death disjoined, may meet no more! 
Misgivings, hard to vanquish or control, 
Mix with the day, and cross the hour of rest ; 
While all the future, for thy purer soul, 
With ' sober certainties ' of love is blest. 
That sigh of thine, not meant for human ear, 
Tells that these words thy humbleness offend ; 
Yet bear me up — else faltering in the rear 
Of a steep march : support me to the end. 
Peace settles where the intellect is meek, 
And Love is dutiful in thought and deed ; 
Through Thee communion with that Love I seek : 
The faith Heaven strengthens where he moulds the 
Creed.

LAMENT OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS. 
ON THE EVE OP A NEW YEAR. 
I. 
Smile of the Moon ! — for so I name 
That silent greeting from above ; 
A gentle flash of light that came 
From her whom drooping captives love ; 
Or art thou of still higher birth % 
Thou that didst part the clouds of earth, 
My torpor to reprove ! 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

 

Bright boon of pitying Heaven ! — alas, 
I may not trust thy placid cheer ! 
Pondering that Time to-night will pass 
The threshold of another year ; 
For years to me are sad and dull ; 
My very moments are too full 
Of hopelessness and fear. 

A Woman rules my prison's key ; 
A sister Queen, against the bent 
Of law and holiest sympathy, 
Detains me, doubtful of the event ; 
Great God, who feel'st for my distress, 
My thoughts are all that I possess, 
keep them innocent ! 

And yet, the soul-awakening gleam, 
That struck perchance the farthest cone 
Of Scotland's rocky wilds, did seem 
To visit me, and me alone ; 
Me, unapproached by any friend, 
Save those who to my sorrows lend 
Tears due unto their own. 

To-night the church-tower bells will r inn- 
Through these wide realms a festive peal 
To the new year a welcoming ; 
A tuneful offering for the weal 
Of happy millions lulled in sleep ; 
While I am forced to watch and weep, 
By wounds that may not heal. 

Born all too high, by wedlock raised 
Still higher — to be cast thus low ! 
Would that mine eyes had never gazed 
On aught of more ambitious show 
Than the sweet flowerets of the fields ! 
— It is my royal state that yields 
This bitterness of woe. 


Yet how ? — for I, if there be truth 
In the world's voice, was passing fair ; 
And beauty, for confiding youth, 
Those shocks of passion can prepare 
That kill the bloom before its time ; 
And blanch, without the owner's crime, 
The most resplendent hair. 

Unblest distinction ! showered on me 
To bind a lingering life in chains : 
All that could quit my grasp, or flee, 
Is gone ; — but not the subtle stains 
Fixed in the spirit ; for even here 
Can I be proud that jealous fear 
Of what I was remains. 

Farewell desire of human aid, 
Which abject mortals vainly court ! 
By friends deceived, by foes betrayed, 
Of fears the prey, of hopes the sport ; 
Nought but the world-redeeming Cross 
Is able to supply my loss, 
My burthen to support. 

Hark ! the death-note of the year 
Sounded by the castle-clock ! 
From her sunk eyes a stagnant tear 
Stole forth, unsettled by the shock ; 
But oft the woods renewed their green, 
Ere the tired head of Scotland's Queen 
Reposed upon the block !

THE COMPLAINT 
OF A FORSAKEN INDIAN WOMAN. 
[When a Northern Indian, from sickness, is unablr to con- 
tinue his journey with his companions, he is left behind, 
covered over with deer-skins, and is supplied with water, 
food, and fuel, if the situation of the place will afford it. 
He is informed of the track which his companions intend 
to pursue, and if he be unable to follow, or overtake 
them, he perishes alone in the desert ; unless he should 
have the good fortune to fall in with some other tribes 
of Indians. The females are equally, or still more, 
exposed to the same fate. See that very interesting 
work Hkarnk's Journey from Hudson's Bay to the 
Northern Ocean. In the high northern latitudes, as 
the same writer informs us, when the northern lights 
vary their position in the air, they make a rustling and 
a crackling noise, as alluded to in the following poem.] 

Before I see another day, 
Oh let my body die away ! 
In sleep I heard the northern gleams ; 
The stars, they were among my dreams 
In rustling conflict through the skies, 
I heard,  saw the flashes drive. 

 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

And yet they are upon my eyes, 
And yet I am alive ; 
Before I see another day, 
Oh let my body die away ! 

My fire is dead : it knew no pain ; 
Yet is it dead, and I remain : 
All stiff with ice the ashes lie ; 
And they are dead, and I will die. 
When I was well, I wished to live, 
For clothes, for warmth, for food, and fire 
But they to me no joy can give, 
No pleasure now, and no desire. 
Then here contented will I he ! 
Alone, I cannot fear to die. 

Alas ! ye might have dragged me on 
Another day, a single one ! 
Too soon I yielded to despair ; 
Why did ye listen to my prayer ? 
When ye were gone my limbs were stronger 
And oh, how grievously I rue, 
That, afterwards, a little longer, 
My friends, I did not follow you ! 
For strong and without pain I lay, 
Dear friends, when ye were gone away. 

My Child ! they gave thee to another, 
A woman who was not thy mother. 
When from my arms my Babe they took, 
On me how strangely did he look ! 
Through his whole body something ran, 
A most strange working did I see ; 
— As if he strove to be a man, 
That he might pull the sledge for me : 
And then he stretched his arms, how wild ! 
Oh mercy ! like a helpless child. 

My little joy ! my little pride ! 
In two days more I must have died. 
Then do not weep and grieve for me ; 
I feel I must have died with thee. 
wind, that o'er my head art flying 
The way my friends their course did bend, 
 should not feel the pain of dying, 
Could I with thee a message send ; 
Too soon, my friends, ye went away ; 
For I had many things to say. 

I ' follow you across the snow ; 
Ye travel heavily and slow ; 
In spite of all my weary pain 
I ' look upon your tents again. 
■ — My fire is dead, and snowy white 
The water which beside it stood : 
The wolf has come to me to-night, 
And he has stolen away my food. 
For ever left alone am I ; 
Then wherefore should I fear to die ? 

vtr. K 
Young as I am, my course is run, 
I shall not see another sun ; 
I cannot lift my limbs to know 
If they have any life or no. 
My poor forsaken Child, if I 
For once could have thee close to me, 
With happy heart I then would die, 
And my last thought would happy be ; 
But thou, dear Babe, art far away, 
Nor shall I see another day.

THE LAST OF THE FLOCK. 
i. 
In distant countries have I been, 
And yet I have not often seen 
A healthy man, a man full grown, 
Weep in the public roads, alone. 
But such a one, on English ground, 
And in. the broad highway, I met ; 
Along the broad highway he came, 
His cheeks with tears were wet : 
Sturdy he seemed, though he was sad ; 
And in his amis a Lamb he had. 

He saw me, and he turned aside, 
As if he wished himself to hide : 
And with his coat did then essay 
To wipe those briny tears away. 
I followed him, and said, " My friend, 
What ails you ? wherefore weep you so ? " 
— " Shame on me, Sir ! this lusty Lamb, 
He makes my tears to flow. 
To-day I fetched him from the rock ; 
He is the last of all my flock.

'Till thirty were not left alive 

When I was young, a single man, 

They dwindled, dwindled, one by one ; 

And after youthful follies ran, 

And I may say, that many a time 

Though little given to care and thought, 

I wished they all were gone — 

Yet, so it was, an ewe I bought ; 

Reckless of what might come at last 

And other sheep from her I raised, 

Were but the bitter struggle past. 

As healthy sheep as you might see ; 


And then I married, and was rich 

VTTT. 

As I could wish to be ; 

To wicked deeds I was inclined, 


And wicked fancies crossed my mind ; 

Of sheep I numbered a full score, 

And every man I chanced to see, 

And every year increased my store. 

I thought he knew some ill of me : 


No peace, no comfort could I find, 

TV. 

No ease, within doors or without ; 

Year after year my stock it grew ; 

And, crazily and wearily 

And from this one, this single ewe, 

I went my work about ; 

Full fifty comely sheep I raised, 

And oft was moved to flee from home, 

As fine a flock as ever grazed ! 

And hide my head where wild beasts roam. 

Upon the Quantock hills they fed ; 

They throve, and we at home did thrive :

— This lusty Lamb of all my store 

Sir ! 'twas a precious flock to me, 

Is all that is alive ; 

As dear as my own children be ; 

And now I care not if we die, 

For daily with my growing store 

And perish all of poverty. 

I loved my children more and more. 


Alas ! it was an evil time ; 

V. 

God cursed me in my sore distress ; 

Six Children, Sir ! had I to feed ; 

 prayed, yet every day I thought 

Hard labour in a time of need ! 

I loved my children less ; 

My pride was tamed, and in our grief 

And every week, and every day, 

I of the Parish asked relief. 

My flock it seemed to melt away. 

They said, I was a wealthy man ; 


My sheep upon the uplands fed, 

X. 

And it was fit that thence I took 

They dwindled, Sir, sad sight to see ! 

Whereof to buy us bread. 

From ten to five, from five to three, 

' Do this : how can we give to you,' 

A lamb, a wether, and a ewe ; — 

They cried, ' what to the poor is due ? ' 

And then at last from three to two ; 


And, of my fifty, yesterday 

vr. 

I had but only one : 

I sold a sheep, as they had said, 

And here it lies upon my arm, 

And bought my little children bread, 

Alas ! and I have none ; — 

And they were healthy with their food ; 

To-day I fetched it from the rock ; 

For me — it never did me good. 

It is the last of all my flock." 

A woeful time it was for me, 
To see the end of all my gains,

The pretty flock which I had reared 


With all my care and pains,

To see it melt like snow away — 


For me it was a woeful day.

A PASTORAL BALLAD. 

VII. 

The fields which with covetous spirit we sold, 

Another still ! and still another ! 

Those beautiful fields, the delight of the day, 

A little lamb, and then its mother ! 

Would have brought us more good than a burthen 

It was a vein that never stopped — 

of gold, 

Like blood-drops from my heart they dropped. 

Could we but have been as contented as they.

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

When the troublesome Tempter beset us, said I, 
' Let him come, with his purse proudly grasped in 
his hand ; 
But, Allan, be true to me, Allan, — we'll die 
Before he shall go with an inch of the land ! ' 
There dwelt we, as happy as birds in their bowers ; 
Unfettered as bees that in gardens abide ; 
We could do what we liked with the land, it was ours ; 
And for us the brook murmured that ran by its side. 
But now we are strangers, go early or late ; 
And often, like one overburthened with sin, 
With my hand on the latch of the half-opened gate, 
I look at the fields, but I cannot go in ! 
When I walk by the hedge on a bright summer's 
day, 
Or sit in the shade of my grandfather's tree, 
A stern face it puts on, as if ready to say, 
'What ails you, that you must come creeping to me!' 
With our pastures about ufi, we could not be sad ; 
Our comfort was near if we ever were crost ; 
But the comfort, the blessings, and wealth that we 
had, 
We slighted them all, — and our birth-right was lost. 
Oh, ill-judging sire of an innocent son 
Who must now be a wanderer ! but peace to that 
strain ! 
Think of evening's repose when ourlabourwas done, 
The sabbath's return ; and its leisure's soft chain ! 
And in sickness, if night had been sparing of sleep, 
How cheerful, at sunrise, the hill where I stood, 
Looking down on the kine,and our treasure of sheep 
That besprinkled the field ; 'twas like youth in my 
blood ! 
Now I cleave to the house, and am dull as a snail ; 
And, oftentimes, hear the church-bell with a sigh, 
That follows the thought — We've no land in the vale, 
Save six feet of earth where our forefathers lie !

THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET 
r. 
Where art thou, my beloved Son, 
Where art thou, worse to me than dead ' 
Oh find me, prosperous or undone ! 
Or, if the grave be now thy bed, 

Why am I ignorant of the same 
That I may rest ; and neither blame 
Nor sorrow may attend thy name ? 

Seven years, alas ! to have received 
No tidings of an only child ; 
To have despaired, have hoped, believed, 
And been for evermore beguiled ; 
Sometimes with thoughts of very bliss ! 
I catch at them, and then I miss ; 
Was ever darkness like to this \ 

He was among the prime in worth, 
An object beauteous to behold ; 
Well born, well bred ; I sent him forth 
Ingenuous, innocent, and bold : 
If things ensued that wanted grace, 
As hath been said, they were not base ; 
And never blush was on my face. 

Ah ! little doth the young-one dream, 
When full of play and childish cares, 
What power is in his wildest scream, 
Heard by his mother unawares ! 
He knows it not, he cannot guess : 
Years to a mother bring distress ; 
But do not make her love the less. 

Neglect me ! no, I suffered long 
From that ill thought ; and, being blind, 
Said, ' Pride shall help me in my wrong 
Kind mother have I been, as kind 
As ever breathed : ' and that is true ; 
I 've wet my path with tears like dew, 
Weeping for him when no one knew. 

My Son, if thou be humbled, poor, 
Hopeless of honour and of gain, 
Oh  do not dread thy mother's door ; 
Think not of me with grief and pain : 
I now can see with better eyes ; 
And worldly grandeur I despise, 
And fortune with her gifts and lies. 

Alas ! the fowls of heaven have wings, 
And blasts of heaven will aid their flight; 
They mount — how short a voyage brings 
The wanderers back to their delight ! 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS.  

Chains tie us down by land and sea ; 

There 's nothing stirring in the house 

And wishes, vain as mine, may he 

Save one wee, hungry, nibbling mouse, 

All that is left to comfort thee. 

Then why so busy thou  

vrn. 

Nay ! start not at that sparkling fight ; 

Perhaps some dungeon hears thee groan, 

'Tis but the moon that shines so bright 

Maimed, mangled by inhuman men ; 

On the window pane bedropped with rain : 

Or thou upon a desert thrown 

Then, little Darling ! sleep again, 

Inheritest the lion's den ; 

And wake when it is day. 

Or hast been summoned to the deep, 

. 

Thou, thou and all thy mates, to keep 


An incommunicable sleep.

MATERNAL GRIEF. 

I look for ghosts ; but none will force 

Departed Child ! I could forget thee once 

Their way to me : 'tis falsely said 

Though at my bosom nursed ; this woeful gain 

That there was ever intercourse 

Thy dissolution brings, that in my soul 

Between the living and the dead ; 

Is present and perpetually abides 

For, surely, then I should have sight 

A shadow, never, never to be disjdaced 

Of him I wait for day and night, 

By the returning substance, seen or touched, 

With love and longings infinite. 

Seen by mine eyes, or clasped in my embrace. 


Absence and death how differ they ! and how 

X. 

Shall I admit that nothing can restore 

My apprehensions come in crowds ; 

What one short sigh so easily removed ? — 

I dread the rustling of the grass ; 
The very shadows of the clouds 

Death, life, and sleep, reality and thought, 
Assist me, God, their boundaries to know, 

Have power to shake me as they pass : 

teach me calm submission to thy Will ! 

I question things and do not find 


One that will answer to my mind ; 

The Child she mourned had overstepped the pale 

And all the world appears unkind. 

Of Infancy, but still did breathe the air 


That sanctifies its confines, and partook 

Xf. 

Reflected beams of that celestial light 

Beyond participation lie 
My troubles, and beyond relief : 
If any chance to heave a sigh, 

To all the Little-ones on sinful earth 

Not unvouchsafed — a fight that warmed and 
cheered 
Those several qualities of heart and mind 

They pity me, and not my grief. 
Then come to me, my Son, or send 
Some tidings that my woes may end ; 
I have no other earthly friend ! 
. 

Which, in her own blest nature, rooted deep, 

Daily before the Mother's watchful eye, 

And not hers only, their peculiar charms 


Unfolded, — beauty, for its present self, 
And for its promises to future years,

With not unfrequent rapture fondly hailed. 

THE COTTAGER TO HER INFANT. 

Have you espied upon a dewy lawn 


A pair of Leverets each provoking each 

BY MY SISTER. 

To a continuance of their fearless sport, 

The days are cold, the nights are long, 

Two separate Creatures in their severed gifts 

The north-wind sings a doleful song ; 

Abounding, but so fashioned that, in all 

Then hush again upon my breast ; 

That Nature prompts them to display, their looks, 

All merry things are now at rest, 

Their starts of motion and their fits of rest, 

Save thee, my pretty Love ! 

An undistinguishable style appears 


And character of gladness, as if Spring 

The kitten sleeps upon the hearth, 

Lodged in their innocent bosoms, and the spirit 

The crickets long have ceased their mirth ; 

Of the rejoicing morning were their own.

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

Such union, in the lovely Girl maintained 
And her twin Brother, had the parent seen, 
Ere, pouncing like a ravenous bird of prey, 
Death in a moment parted them, and left 
The Mother, in her turns of anguish, worse 
Than desolate ; for oft-times from the sound 
Of the survivor's sweetest voice (dear child, 
He knew it not) and from his happiest looks, 
Did she extract the food of self-reproach, 
As one that lived ungrateful for the stay 
By Heaven afforded to uphold her maimed 
And tottering spirit. And full oft the Boy, 
Now first acquainted with distress and grief, 
Shrunk from his Mother's presence, shunned with 
fear 
Her sad approach, and stole away to find, 
In his known haunts of joy where'er he might, 
A more congenial object. But, as time 
Softened her pangs and reconciled the child 
To what he saw, he gradually returned, 
Like a scared Bird encouraged to renew 
A broken intercourse ; and, while his eyes 
Were yet with pensive fear and gentle awe 
Turned upon her who bore him, she would stoop 
To imprint a kiss that lacked not power to spread 
Faint colour over both then' pallid cheeks, 
And stilled his tremidous lip. Thus they were calmed 
And cheered ; and now together breathe fresh air 
In open fields ; and when the glare of day 
Is gone, and twilight to the Mother's wish 
Befriends the observance, readily they join 
In walks whose boundary is the lost One's grave, 
Which he with flowers hath planted, finding there 
Amusement, where the Mother does not miss 
Dear consolation, kneeling on the turf 
In prayer, yet blending with that solemn rite 
Of pious faith the vanities of grief ; 
For such, by pitying Angels and by Spirits 
Transferred to regions upon which the clouds 
Of our weak nature rest not, must be deemed 
Those willing tears, and unforbidden sighs, 
And all those tokens of a cherished sorrow, 
Which, soothed and sweetened by the grace of 
Heaven 
As now it is, seems to her own fond heart, 
Immortal as the love that gave it being.

THE SAILOR'S MOTHER. 
One morning (raw it was and wet — 
A foggy day in winter time) 
A Woman on the road I met, 
Not old, though something past her prime : 

Majestic in her person, tall and straight ; 
And like a Roman matron's was her mien and gait. 
The ancient spirit is not dead ; 
Old times, thought I, are breathing there ; 
Proud was I that my country bred 
Such strength, a dignity so fair : 
She begged an alms, like one in poor estate ; 
I looked at her again, nor did my pride abate. 
When from these lofty thoughts I woke, 
" What is it," said I, " that you bear, 
Beneath the covert of your Cloak, 
Protected from this cold damp air ? " 
She answered, soon as she the question heard, 
" A simple burthen, Sir, a little Singing-bird." 
And, thus continuing, she said, 
" I had a Son, who many a day 
Sailed on the seas, but he is dead ; 
In Denmark he was cast away : 
And I have travelled weary miles to see 
If aught which he had owned might still remain 
for me. 
The bird and cage they both were his : 
'Twas my Son's bird ; and neat and trim 
He kept it : many voyages 
The singing-bird had gone with him ; 
When last he sailed, he left the bird behind ; 
From bodings, as might be, that hung upon his mind . 
He to a fellow-lodger's care 
Had left it, to be watched and fed, 
And pipe its song in safety ; — there 
I found it when my Son was dead ; 
And now, God help me for my little wit ! 
I bear it with me, Sir ; — he took so much deb'ght 
in it."

THE CHILDLESS FATHER. 
" Up, Timothy, up with your staff and away ! 
Not a soul in the village this morning will stay ; 
The hare has just started from Hamilton's grounds, 
And Skiddaw is glad with the cry of the hounds." 
— Of coats and of jackets grey, scarlet, and green, 
On the slopes of the pastures all colours were seen ; 
With their comely blue aprons, and caps white as 
snow, 
The girls on the hills made a holiday show.

Fresh sprigs of green box-wood, not six months 
before, 
Filled the funeral basin at Timothy's door ; 
A coffin through Timothy's threshold had past ; 
One Child did it bear, and that Child was his last. 
Now fast up the dell came the noise and the fray, 
The horse and the horn, and the hark ! hark away ! 
Old Timothy took up his staff, and he shut 
With a leisurely motion the door of his hut. 
Perhaps to himself at that moment he said ; 
' The key I must take, for my Ellen is dead.' 
But of this in my ears not a word did he speak ; 
And he went to the chase with a tear on his cheek.

XXIX. 
THE EMIGRANT MOTHER. 
Once in a lonely hamlet I sojourned 
In which a Lady driven from France did dwell ; 
The big and lesser griefs with which she mourned, 
In friendship she to me would often tell. 
This Lady, dwelling upon British ground, 
Where she was childless, daily would repair 
To a poor neighbouring cottage ; as I found, 
For sake of a young Child whose home was there. 
Once having seen her clasp with fond embrace 
This Child, I chanted to myself a lay, 
Endeavouring, in our English tongue, to trace 
Such things as she unto the Babe might say : 
And thus, from what I heard and knew, or guessed, 
My song the workings of her heart expressed. 

" Dear Babe, thou daughter of another, 
One moment let me be thy mother ! 
An infant's face and looks are thine 
And sure a mother's heart is mine : 
Thy own dear mother 's far away, 
At labour in the harvest field : 
Thy little sister is at play ; — 
What warmth, what comfort would it yield 
To my poor heart, if thou wouldst be 
One little hour a child to me ! 

 In several parts of the North of England, when a 
funeral takes place, a basin full of sprigs of box-wood is 
placed at the door of the house from which the coffin is 
taken up, and each person who attends the funeral ordi- 
narily takes a sprig of this box-wood, and throws it into 
the grave of the deceased. 

Across the waters I am come, 
And I have left a babe at home : 
A long, long way of land and sea ! 
Come to me — I 'm no enemy : 
I am the same who at thy side 
Sate yesterday, and made a nest 
For thee, sweet Baby ! — thou hast tried, 
Thou know'st the pillow of my breast ; 
Good, good art thou : — alas ! to me 
Far more than I can be to thee. 

Here, little Darling, dost thou he ; 
An infant thou, a mother I ! 
Mine wilt thou be, thou hast no fears ; 
Mine art thou — spite of these my tears. 
Alas ! before I left the spot, 
My baby and its dwellhig-place ; 
The nurse said to me, ' Tears should not 
Be shed upon an infant's face, 
It was unlucky '—no, no, no ; 
No truth is in them who say so ! 

My own dear Little-one will sigh, 
Sweet Babe ! and they will let him die. 
' He pines,' they ' say, ' it is his doom, 
And you may see his hour is come.' 
Oh ! had he but thy cheerful smiles, 
Limbs stout as thine, and lips as gay, 
Thy looks, thy cunning, and thy wiles, 
And countenance like a summer's day, 
They would have hopes of him ; — and then 
I should behold his face again ! 

'Tis gone — like dreams that we forget ; 
There was a smile or two — yet — yet 
I can remember them, I see 
The smiles, worth all the world to me. 
Dear Baby ! I must lay thee down ; 
Thou troublest me with strange alarms ; 
Smiles hast thou, bright ones of thy own ; 
I cannot keep thee in my arms ; 
For they confound me ; — where — where is 
That last, that sweetest smile of his \ 

Oh ! how I love thee ! — we will stay 
Together hei'e this one half day. 
My sister's child, who bears my name, 
From France to sheltering England came :

She with her mother crossed the sea ; 
The babe and mother near me dwell : 
Yet does my yearning heart to thee 
Turn rather, though I love her well : 
Rest, little Stranger, rest thee here ! 
Never was any child more dear ! 
vrr. 
— I cannot help it ; ill intent 
I 've none, my pretty Innocent ! 
I weep — I know they do thee wrong, 
These tears — and my poor idle tongue. 
Oh, what a kiss was that ! my cheek 
How cold it is ! but thou art good ; 
Thine eyes are on me — they would speak, 
I think, to help me if they could. 
Blessings upon that soft, warm face, 
My heart again is in its place ! 
Villi 
While thou art mine, my little Love, 
This cannot be a sorrowful grove ; 
Contentment, hope, and mother's glee, 
I seem to find them all in thee : 
Here 's grass to play with, here are flowers ; 
I ' call thee by my darling's name ; 
Thou hast, I think, a look of ours, 
Thy features seem to me the same ; 
His little sister thou shalt be ; 
And, when once more my home I see, 
I ' tell him many tales of Thee."

VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA. 
The following tale was written as an Episode, in a work 
from which its length may perhaps exclude it. The 
facts are true ; no invention as to these has bei j n 
exercised, as none was needed. 
happy time of youthful lovers (thus 
My story may begin) balmy time, 
In which a love-knot on a lady's brow 
Is fairer than the fairest star in heaven ! 
To such inheritance of blessed fancy 
(Fancy that sports more desperately with minds 
Than ever fortune hath been known to do) 
The high-born Vaudracour was brought, by years 
Whose progress had a little overstepped 
His stripling prime. A town of small repute, 
Among the vine-clad mountains of Auvergne, 
Was the Youth's birth-place. There he wooed a 
Maid 
Who heard the heart-felt music of his suit 

With answering vows. Plebeian was the stock, 
Plebeian, though ingenuous, the stock, 
From which her graces and her honours sprung : 
And hence the father of the enamoured Youih, 
With haughty indignation, spurned the thought 
Of such alliance. — From their cradles up, 
With but a step between their several homes, 
Twins had they been in pleasure ; after strife 
And petty quarrels, had grown fond again ; 
Each other's advocate, each other's stay ; 
And, in their happiest moments, not content, 
If more divided than a sportive pair 
Of sea-fowl, conscious both that they are hovering 
Within the eddy of a common blast, 
Or hidden only by the concave depth 
Of neighbouring billows from each other's sight. 
Thus, not without concurrence of an age 
Unknown to memory, was an earnest given 
By ready nature for a life of love, 
For endless constancy, and placid truth ; 
But whatsoe'er of such rare treasure lay 
Reserved, had fate permitted, for support 
Of their maturer years, his present mind 
Was under fascination ; — he beheld 
A vision, and adored the thing he saw. 
Arabian fiction never filled the world 
With half the wonders that were wrought for him. 
Earth breathed in one great presence of the spring ; 
Life turned the meanest of her implements, 
Before his eyes, to price above all gold ; 
The house she dwelt in was a sainted shrine ; 
Her chamber-window did surpass in glory 
The portals of the dawn ; all paradise 
Could, by the simple opening of a door, 
Let itself in upon him : — pathways, walks, 
Swarmed with enchantment, till his spirit sank, 
Surcharged, within him, overblest to move 
Beneath a sun that wakes a weary world 
To its dull round of ordinary cares ; 
A man too happy for mortality ! 
So passed the time, till whether through effect 
Of some unguarded moment that dissolved 
Virtuous restraint — ah, speak it, think it, not ! 
Deem rather that the fervent Youth, who saw 
So many bars between his present state 
And the dear haven where he wished to be 
In honourable wedlock with his Love, 
Was in his judgment tempted to decline 
To perilous weakness., and entrust his cause 
To nature for a happy end of all ; 
Deem that by such fond hope the Youth was swayed, 
And bear with then' transgression, when  add 

VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA. 

 

That Julia, wanting yet the name of wife, 
Carried about her for a secret grief 
The promise of a mother. 
To conceal 
The threatened shame, the parents of the Maid 
Found means to hurry her away by night, 
And unforewarned, that in some distant spot 
She might remain shrouded in privacy, 
Until the babe was born. When morning came, 
The Lover, thus bereft, stung with his loss, 
And all uncertain whither he should turn, 
Chafed like a wild beast in the toils ; but soon 
Discovering traces of the fugitives, 
Their steps he followed to the Maid's retreat. 
Easily may the sequel be divined — 
Walks to and fro — watchings at every hour ; 
And the fair Captive, who, whene'er she may, 
Is busy at her casement as the swallow 
Fluttering its pinions, almost within reach, 
About the pendent nest, did thus espy 
Her Lover ! — thence a stolen interview, 
Accomplished under friendly shade of night. 
I pass the raptures of the pair ; — such theme 
Is, by innumerable poets, touched 
In more delightful verse than skill of mine 
Could fashion ; chiefly by that darling bard 
Who told of Juliet and her Romeo, 
And of the lark's note heard before its time, 
And of the streaks that laced the severing clouds 
In the unrelenting east.— Through all her courts 
The vacant city slept ; the busy winds, 
That keep no certain intervals of rest, 
Moved not ; meanwhile the galaxy displayed 
Her fires, that like mysterious pulses beat 
Aloft ; — momentous but uneasy bliss ! 
To their full hearts the universe seemed hung 
On that brief meeting's slender filament ! 
They parted ; and the generous Vaudracour 
Reached speedily the native threshold, bent 
On making (so the Lovers had agreed) 
A sacrifice of birthright to attain 
A final portion from his' father's hand ; 
Which granted, Bride and Bridegroom then would 
flee 
To some remote and solitary place, 
Shady as night, and beautiful as heaven, 
Where they may live, with no one to behold 
Their happiness, or to disturb their love. 
But now of this no whisper ; not the less, 
If ever an obtrusive word were dropped 
Touching the matter of his passion, still, 
In his stern father's hearing, Vaudracour 

Persisted openly that death alone 
Should abrogate his human privilege 
Divine, of swearing everlasting truth, 
Upon the altar, to the Maid he loved. 
"You shall be baffled in your mad intent 
If there be justice in the court of France," 
Muttered the Father. — From these words the Youth 
Conceived a terror ; and, by night or day, 
Stirred nowhere without weapons, that full soon 
Found dreadful provocation : for at night 
When to his chamber he retired, attempt 
Was made to seize him by three armed men, 
Acting, in furtherance of the father's will, 
Under a private signet of the State. 
One the rash Youth's ungovernable hand 
Slew, and as quickly to a second gave 
A perilous wound — he shuddered to behold 
The breathless corse ; then peacefully resigned 
His person to the law, was lodged in prison, 
And wore the fetters of a criminal. 
Have you observed a tuft of winged seed 
That, from the dandelion's naked stalk, 
Mounted aloft, is suffered not to use 
Its natural gifts for purposes of rest, 
Driven by the autumnal whirlwind to and fro 
Through the wide element % or have you marked 
The heavier substance of a leaf-clad bough, 
Within the vortex of a foaming flood, 
Tormented ? by such aid you may conceive 
The perturbation that ensued ; — ah, no ! 
Desperate the Maid — the Youth is stained with 
blood ; 
Unmatchable on earth is their disquiet ! 
Yet as the troubled seed and tortured bough 
Is Man, subjected to despotic sway. 
For him, by private influence with the Court, 
Was pardon gained, and liberty procured; 
But not without exaction of a pledge, 
Which liberty and love dispersed in air. 
He flew to her from whom they would divide him — 
He clove to her who could not give him peace — 
Yea, his first word of greeting was, — " All right 
Is gone from me ; my lately-towering hopes, 
To the least fibre of their lowest root, 
Are withered ; thou no longer canst be mine, , 
I thine — the conscience-stricken must not woo 
The unruffled Innocent, — I see thy face, 
Behold thee, and my misery is complete ! " 
" One,are wenot ? " exclaimed the Maiden — " One, 
For innocence and youth, for weal and woe ? " 

 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

Then with the father's name she coupled words 
Of vehement indignation ; but the Youth 
Checked her with filial meekness ; for no thought 
Uncharitable crossed his mind, no sense 
Of hasty anger rising in the eclipse 
Of true domestic loyalty, did e'er 
Find place within his bosom. — Once again 
The persevering wedge of tyranny 
Achieved their separation : and once more 
Were they united, — to be yet again 
Disparted, pitiable lot ! But here 
A portion of the tale may well be left 
In silence, though my memory could add 
Much how the Youth, in scanty space of time, 
Was traversed from without ; much, too, of thoughts 
That occupied his days in so'.itude 
Under privation and restraint ; and what, 
Through dark and shapeless fear of tilings to come, 
And what, through strong compunction for the past, 
He suffered — breaking down hi heart and mind ! 
Doomed to a third and last captivity, 
His freedom he recovered on the eve 
Of Julia's travail. When the babe was born, 
Its presence tempted him to cherish schemes 
Of future happiness. "You shall return, 
Julia," said he, "and to your father's house 
Go with the child. — You have been wretched ; yet 
The silver shower, whose reckless burthen weighs 
Too heavily upon the lily's head, 
Oft leaves a saving moisture at its root. 
Malice, beholding you, will melt away. 
Go ! — 'tis a town where both of us were born ; 
None will reproach you, for our truth is known ; 
And if, amid those once-bright bowers, our fate 
Remain unpitied, pity is not in man. 
With ornaments — the prettiest, nature yields 
Or art can fashion, shall you deck our boy, 
And feed his countenance with your own sweet looks 
Till no one can resist him. — Now, even now, 
I see him sporting on the sunny lawn ; 
My father from the window sees Mm too ; 
Startled, as if some new-created thing 
Enriched the earth, or Faery of the woods 
Bounded before him ; — but the unweeting Child 
Shall by his beauty win his grandsire's heart 
So that it shall be softened, and our loves 
End happily, as they began ! " 
These gleams 
Appeared but seldom ; oftener was he seen 
Propping a pale and melancholy face 
Upon the Mother's bosom ; resting thus 
His head upon one breast, while from the other 
The Babe was drawing in its quiet food. 

— That pillow is no longer to be thine, 
Fond Youth ! that mournful solace now must pass 
Into the list of things t'nat cannot be ! 
Unwedded Julia, terror-smitten, hears 
The sentence, by her mother's lip pronounced, 
That dooms her to a convent. — Who shall tell, 
Who dares report, the tidings to the lord 
Of her affections ? so they blindly asked 
Who knew not to what quiet depths a weight 
Of agony had pressed the Sufferer down : 
The word, by others dreaded, he can hear 
Composed and silent, without visible sign 
Of even the least emotion. Noting this, 
When the impatient object of his love 
Upbraided him with slackness, he returned 
No answer, only took the mother's hand 
And kissed it ; seemingly devoid of pain, 
Or care, that what so tenderly he pressed, 
Was a dependant on the obdurate heart 
Of one who came to disunite their lives 
For ever — sad alternative ! preferred, 
By the unbending Parents of the Maid, 
To secret 'spousals meanly disavowed. 
—So be it ! 
In the city he remained 
A season after Julia had withdrawn 
To those religious walls. He, too, departs — 
Who with him ? — even the senseless Little-one. 
With that sole charge he passed the city-gates, 
For the last time, attendant by the side 
Of a close chair, a litter, or sedan, 
In which the Babe was carried. To a hill, 
That rose a brief league distant from the town, 
The dwellers in that house where he had lodged 
Accompanied his steps, by anxious love 
Impelled ; — they parted from him there, and stood 
Watching below till he had disappeared 
On the hill top. His eyes he scarcely took, 
Throughout that journey, from the vehicle 
(Slow-moving ark of all Ms hopes !) that veiled 
The tender infant : and at every inn, 
And under every hospitable tree 
At which the bearers halted or reposed, 
Laid Mm with timid care upon his knees, 
And looked, as mothers ne'er were known to look, 
Upon the nursling which Ms arms embraced. 
This was the manner in wMch Vaudracour 
Departed with his infant ; and thus reached 
His father's house, where to the innocent child 
Admittance was denied. The young man spake 
No word of mdignation or reproof, 
But of Ms father begged, a last request, 
That a retreat might be assigned to him 

THE IDIOT BOY. 

 

Where in forgotten quiet he might dwell, 
With such allowance as his wants required ; 
For wishes he had none. To a lodge that stood 
Deep in a forest, with leave given, at the age 
Of four-and-twenty summers he withdrew ; 
And thither took with him his motherless Babe, 
And one domestic for their common needs, 
An aged woman. It consoled him here 
To attend upon the orphan, and perform 
Obsequious service to the precious child, 
Which, after a short time, by some mistake 
Or indiscretion of the Father, died. — 
The Tale I follow to its last recess 
Of suffering or of peace, I know not which : 
Theirs be the blame who caused the woe, not mine ! 
From this time forth he never shared a smile 
With mortal creature. An Inhabitant 
Of that same town, in which the pair had left 
So lively a remembrance of their griefs, 
By chance of business, coming within reach 
Of his retirement, to the forest lodge 
Repaired, but only found the matron there, 
Who told lhhi that his pains were thrown away, 
For that her Master never uttered word 
To living thing — not even to her. — Behold ! 
While they were speaking, Vaudracour approached; 
But, seeing some one near, as on the latch 
Of the garden-gate his hand was laid, he shrunk — 
And, like a shadow, glided out of view. 
Shocked at his savage aspect, from the place 
The visitor retired. 
Thus lived the Youth 
Cut off from all intelligence with man, 
And shunning even the light of common day ; 
Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through 
France 
Full speedily resounded, public hope, 
Or personal memory of his own deep wrongs, 
Rouse him : but in those solitary shades 
His days he wasted, an imbecile mind !

THE IDIOT BOY. 

'Tis eight o'clock,— a clear March night, 
The moon is up, — the sky is blue, 
The owlet, in the moonlight air, 
Shouts from nobody knows where ; 
He lengthens out his lonely shout, 
Halloo ! halloo ! a long halloo ! 

— Why bustle thus about your door, 
What means this bustle, Betty Foy ? 
Why are you in this mighty fret ! 
And why on horseback have you set 
Him whom you love, your Idiot Boy \ 
Scarcely a soul is out of bed ; 
Good Betty, put him down again ; 
His lips with joy they burr at you ; 
But, Betty ! what has he to do 
With stirrup, saddle, or with rein  
But Betty 's bent on her intent ; 
For her good neighbour, Susan Gale, 
Old Susan, she who dwells alone, 
Is sick, and makes a piteous moan, 
As if her very life would fail. 
There 's not a house within a mile, 
No hand to help them in distress ; 
Old Susan lies a-bed in pain, 
And sorely puzzled are the twain, 
For what she ails they cannot guess. 
And Betty's husband 's at the wood, 
Where by the week he doth abide, 
A woodman in the distant vale ; 
There 's none to help poor Susan Gale ; 
What must be done \ what will betide % 
And Betty from the lane has fetched 
Her Pony, that is mild and good j 
Whether he be in joy or pain, 
Feeding at will along the lane, 
Or bringing faggots from the wood. 
And he is all in travelling trim, — 
And, by the moonlight, Betty Foy 
Has on the well-girt saddle set 
(The like was never heard of yet) 
Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy. 
And he must post without delay 
Across the bridge and through the dale, 
And by the church, and o'er the down, 
To bring a Doctor from the town, 
Or she will die, old Susan Gale. 
There is no need of boot or spur, 
There is no need of whip or wand ; 
For Johnny has his holly-bough, 
And with a hurly-burly now 
He shakes the green bough in his hand. 

 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

And Betty o'er and o'er has told 
The Boy, who is her best delight, 
Both what to follow, what to shun, 
What do, and what to leave undone, 
How turn to left, and how to right. 
And Betty's most especial charge, 
Was, " Johnny ! Johnny ! mind that you 
Come home again, nor stop at all, — 
Come home again, whate'er befal, 
My Johnny, do, I pray you do." 
To this did Johnny answer make, 
Both with his head and with his hand, 
And proudly shook the bridle too ; 
And then ! his words were not a few, 
Which Betty well could understand. 
And now that Johnny is just going, 
Though Betty 's in a mighty flurry, 
She gently pats the Pony's side, 
On which her Idiot Boy must ride, 
And seems no longer in a hurry. 
But when the Pony moved his legs, 
Oh ! then for the poor Idiot Boy ! 
For joy he cannot hold the bridle, 
For joy his head and heels are idle, 
He 's idle all for very joy. 
And while the Pony moves his legs, 
In Johnny's left hand you may see 
The green bough motionless and dead : 
The Moon that shines above bis head 
Is not more still and mute than he. 
His heart it was so full of glee, 
That till full fifty yards were gone, 
He quite forgot his holly whip, 
And all his skill in horsemanship : 
Oh ! happy, happy, happy John. 
And while the Mother, at the door, 
Stands fixed, her face with joy o'erflows, 
Proud of herself, and proud of him, 
She sees him in his travelling trim, 
How quietly her Johnny goes. 
The silence of her Idiot Boy, 
What hopes it sends to Betty 's heart ! 
He 's at the guide-post — he turns right ; 
She watches till he 's out of sight, 
And Betty will not then depart. 

Burr, burr — now Johnny's lips they burr, 
As loud as any mill, or near it ; 
Meek as a lamb the Pony moves, 
And Johnny makes the noise he loves, 
And Betty listens, glad to hear it. 
Away she hies to Susan Gale : 
Her Messenger 's in merry tune ; 
The owlets hoot, the owlets curr, 
And Johnny's lips they burr, burr, burr, 
As on he goes beneath the moon. 
His steed and he right well agree ; 
For of this Pony there 's a rumour, 
That, should he lose his eyes and ears, 
And should he live a thousand years, 
He never will be out of humour. 
But then he is a horse that thinks ! 
And when he thinks, his pace is slack ; 
Now, though he knows poor Johnny well, 
Yet, for his life, he cannot tell 
What he has got upon his back. 
So through the moonlight lanes they go, 
And far into the moonlight dale, 
And by the church, and o'er the down, 
To bring a Doctor from the town, 
To comfort poor old Susan Gale. 
And Betty, now at Susan's side, 
Is in the middle of her story, 
What speedy help her Boy will bring, 
With many a most diverting thing, 
Of Johnny's wit, and Johnny's glory. 
And Betty, still at Susan's side, 
By this time is not quite so flurried : 
Demure with porringer and plate 
She sits, as if in Susan's fate 
Her life and soul were buried. 
But Betty, poor good woman ! she, 
You plainly in her face may read it, 
Could lend out of that moment's store 
Five years of happiness or more 
To any that might need it. 
But yet I guess that now and then 
With Betty all was not so well ; 
And to the road she turns her ears, 
And thence full many a sound she hears, 
Which she to Susan will not tell. 

THE IDIOT BOY. 

 

Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans ; 
" As sure as there 's a moon in heaven," 
Cries Betty, " he ' be back again ; 
They ' both be here — 'tis almost ten — 
Both will be here before eleven." 
Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans ; 
The clock gives warning for eleven ; 
'Tis on the stroke — " He must be near," 
Quoth Betty, " and will soon be here, 
As sure as there 's a moon in heaven." 
The clock is on the stroke of twelve, 
And Johnny is not yet in sight : 
— The Moon 's in heaven, as Betty sees, 
But Betty is not quite at ease ; 
And Susan has a dreadful night. 
And Betty, half an hour ago, 
On Johnny vile reflections cast : 
" A little idle sauntering Thing !" 
With other names, an endless string ; 
But now that time is gone and past. 
And Betty 's drooping at the heart, 
That happy time all past and gone, 
" How can it be he is so late ? 
The Doctor, he has made him wait ; 
Susan ! they ' both be here anon." 
And Susan 's growing worse and worse, 
And Betty 's in a sad quandary; 
And then there 's nobody to say 
If she must go, or she must stay ! 
— She 's in a sad quandary. 
The clock is on the stroke of one ; 
But neither Doctor nor his Guide 
Appears along the moonlight road ; 
There 's neither horse nor man abroad, 
And Betty 's still at Susan's side. 
And Susan now begins to fear 
Of sad mischances not a few, 
That Johnny may perhaps be drowned ; 
Or lost, perhaps, and never found ; 
Which they must both for ever rue. 
She prefaced half a hint of this 
With, " God forbid it should be true !" 
At the first word that Susan said 
Cried Betty, rising from the bed, 
" Susan, I 'd gladly stay with you. 

I must be gone, I must away : 
Consider, Johnny 's but half-wise ; it 
Susan, we must take care of him, 
If he is hurt in life or limb " — 
" Oh God forbid ! " poor Susan cries. 
" What can I do \ " says Betty, going, 
" What can I do to ease your pain ? 
Good Susan tell me, and I ' stay ; 
I fear you 're in a dreadful way, 
But I shall soon be back again." 
" Nay, Betty, go ! good Betty, go ! 
There's nothing that can ease my pain." 
Then off she hies ; but with a prayer 
That God poor Susan's life would spare, 
Till she comes back again. 
So, through the moonlight lane she goes, 
And far into the moonlight dale ; 
And how she ran, and how she walked, 
And all that to herself she tallied, 
Would surely be a tedious tale. 
In high and low, above, below, 
In great and small, in round and square, 
In tree and tower was Johnny seen, 
In bush and brake, in black and green ; 
'Twas Johnny, Johnny, every where. 
And while she crossed the bridge, there came 
A thought with which her heart is sore — 
Johnny perhaps his horse forsook, 
To hunt the moon within the brook, 
And never will be heard of more. 
Now is she high upon the down, 
Alone amid a prospect wide ; 
There 's neither Johnny nor his Horse 
Among the fern or hi the gorse ; 
There 's neither Doctor nor his Guide. 
" Oh saints ! what is become of him ? 
Perhaps he 's climbed into an oak, 
Where he will stay till he is dead ; 
Or, sadly he has been misled, 
And joined the wandering gipsy-folk. 
Or him that wicked Pony 's carried 
To the dark cave, the goblin's hall ; 
Or in the castle he's pursuing 
Among the ghosts his own undoing ; 
Or playing with the waterfall."

POEMS POUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS, 

At poor old Susan then she railed, 
■While to the town she posts away ; 
" If Susan had not been so ill, 
Alas ! I should have had him still, 
My Johnny, till my dying day." 

And now she 's high upon the down, 
And she can see a mile of road : 
" cruel ! I 'm almost threescore ; 
Such night as this was ne'er before, 
There 's not a single soul abroad." 

Poor Betty, in this sad distemper, 
The Doctor's self could hardly spare : 
Unworthy things she talked, and wild ; 
Even he, of cattle the most mild, 
The Pony had his share. 

She listens, but she cannot hear 
The foot of horse, the voice of man ; 
The streams with softest sound are flowing, 
The grass you almost hear it growing, 
You hear it now, if e'er you can. 

But now she 's fairly in the town, 
And to the Doctor's door she hies ; 
'Tis silence all on every side ; 
The town so long, the town so wide, 
Is silent as the skies. 

The owlets through the long blue night 
Are shouting to each other still : 
Fond lovers ! yet not quite hob nob, 
They lengthen out the tremulous sob, 
That echoes far from hill to hill. 

And now she 's at the Doctor's door, 
She lifts the knocker, rap, rap, rap ; 
The Doctor at the casement shows 
His glimmering eyes that peep and doze ! 
And one hand rubs his old night-cap. 

Poor Betty now has lost all hope, 
Her thoughts are bent on deadly sin, 
A green-grown pond she just has past, 
And from the brink she hurries fast, 
Lest she should drown herself therein. 

K Oh Doctor ! Doctor ! where 's my Johnny ?" 
" I 'm here, what is 't you want with me V 
" Oh Sir ! you know I 'm Betty Foy, 
And I have lost my poor dear Boy, 
You know him — him you often see ; 

And now she sits her down and weeps ; 
Such tears she never shed before ; 
" Oh dear, dear Pony ! my sweet joy ! 
Oh carry back my Idiot Boy ! 
And we will ne'er o'erload thee more." 

He 's not so wise as some folks be :" 
" The devil take his wisdom !" said 
The Doctor, looking somewhat grim, 
" What, Woman ! should I know of him ? " 
And, grumbling, he went back to bed ! 

A thought is come into her head : 
The Pony he is mild and good, 
And we have always used him well ; 
Perhaps he 's gone along the dell, 
And carried Johnny to the wood. 

" woe is me ! woe is me ! 
Here will I die ; here will I die ; 
I thought to find my lost one here, 
But he is neither far nor near, 
Oh ! what a wretched Mother I !" 

Then up she springs as if on wings ; 
She thinks no more of deadly sin ; 
If Betty fifty ponds should see, 
The last of all her thoughts would be 
To drown herself therein. 

She stops, she stands, she looks about; 
Which way to turn she cannot tell. 
Poor Betty ! it would ease her pain 
If she had heart to knock again ; 
— The clock strikes three — a dismal knell ! 

Pleader ! now that I might tell 
What Johnny and his Horse are doing ! 
What they 've been doing all this time, 
Oh could I put it into rhyme, 
A most delightful tale pursuing ! 

Then up along the town she hies, 
No wonder if her senses fail ; 
This piteous news so much it shocked her, 
She quite forgot to send the Doctor, 
To comfort poor old Susan Gale. 

Perhaps, and no unlikely thought ! 
He with his Pony now doth roam 
The cliffs and peaks so high that are, 
To lay his hands upon a star, 
And in his pocket bring it home. 

THE IDIOT BOY. 

 

Perhaps he 's turned himself about, 
His face unto his horse's tail, 
And, still and mute, in wonder lost, 
All silent as a horseman-ghost, 
He travels slowly down the vale. 
And now, perhaps, is hunting sheep, 
A fierce and dreadful hunter he ; 
Yon valley, now so trim and green, 
In five months' time, should he be seen, 
A desert wilderness will be ! 
Perhaps, with head and heels on fire, 
And like the very sold of evil, 
He 's galloping away, away, 
And so will gallop on for aye, 
The bane of all that dread the devil ! 
I to the Muses have been bound 
These fourteen years, by strong indentures : 
gentle Muses ! let me tell 
But half of what to him befel ; 
He surely met with strange adventures. 
gentle Muses ! is this kind ? 
Why will ye thus my suit repel ? 
Why of your further aid bereave me ? 
And can ye thus unfriended leave me ; 
Ye Muses ! whom I love so well ? 
Who 's yon, that, near the waterfall, 
Which thunders down with headlong force, 
Beneath the moon, yet shining fair, 
As careless as if nothing were, 
Sits upright on a feeding horse ? 
Unto his horse— there feeding free, 
He seems, I think, the rein to give ; 
Of moon or stars he takes no heed ; 
Of such we in romances read : 
— 'Tis Johnny ! Johnny ! as I live. 
And that's the very Pony, too ! 
Where is she, where is Betty Foy ? 
She hardly can sustain her fears ; 
The roaring waterfall she hears. 
And cannot find her Idiot Boy. 
Your Pony 's worth his weight in gold : 
Then calm your terrors, Betty Foy ! 
She 's coming from among the trees, 
And now all full in view she sees 
Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy. 

And Betty sees the Pony too : 
Why stand you thus, good Betty Foy  
It is no goblin, 'tis no ghost, 
'Tis he whom you so long have lost, 
He whom you love, your Idiot Boy. 
She looks again — her arms are up — 
She screams — she camiot move for joy ; 
She darts, as with a torrent's force, 
She almost has o'erturned the Horse, 
And fast she holds her Idiot Boy. 
And Johnny burrs, and laughs aloud ; 
Whether in cunning or in joy 
I cannot tell ; but while he laughs, 
Betty a drunken pleasure quaffs 
To hear again her Idiot Boy. 
And now she 's at the Pony's tail, 
And now is at the Pony's head, — 
On that side now, and now on this ; 
And, almost stifled with her bliss, 
A few sad tears does Betty shed. 
She kisses o'er and o'er again 
Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy ; 
She 's happy here, is happy there, 
She is uneasy every where ; 
Her limbs are all alive with joy. 
She pats the Pony, where or when 
She knows not, happy Betty Foy ! 
The little Pony glad may be, 
But he is milder far than she, 
You hardly can perceive his joy. 
" Oh ! Johnny, never mind the Doctor ; 
You 've done your best, and that is all : " 
She took the reins, when this was said, 
And gently turned the Pony's head 
From the loud waterfall. 
By this the stars were almost gone, 
The moon was setting on the hill, 
So pale you scarcely looked at her : 
The little birds began to stir, 
Though yet their tongues were still. 
The Pony, Betty, and her Boy, 
Wind slowly through the woody dale ; 
And who is she, betimes abroad, 
That hobbles up the steep rough road ? 
Who is it, but old Susan Gale ? 

 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

Long time lay Susan lost in thought; 
And many dreadful fears beset her, 
Both for her Messenger and Nurse ; 
And, as her mind grew worse and worse, 
Her body — it grew better. 
She turned, she tossed herself in bed, 
On all sides doubts and terrors met her ; 
Point after point did she discuss ; 
And, while her mind was fighting thus, 
Her body still grew better. 
"Alas ! what is become of them ? 
These fears can never be endured ; 
I ' to the wood." — The word scarce said, 
Did Susan rise up from her bed, 
As if by magic cured. 
Away she goes up hill and down, 
And to the wood at length is come ; 
She spies her Friends, she shouts a greeting ; 
Oh me ! it is a merry meeting 
As ever was in Christendom. 
The owls have hardly sung their last, 
While our four travellers homeward wend ; 
The owls have hooted all night long, 
And with the owls began my song, 
And with the owls must end. 
For while they all were travelling home, 
Cried Betty, "Tell us, Johnny, do, 
Where all this long night you have been, 
What you have heard, what you have seen : 
And, Johnny, mind you tell us true." 
Now Johnny all night long had heard 
The owls in tuneful concert strive ; 
No doubt too he the moon had seen ; 
For in the moonlight he had been 
From eight o'clock till five. 
And thus, to Betty's question, he 
Made answer, like a traveller bold, 
(His very words I give to you,) 
" The cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo, 
And the sun did shine so cold ! " 
— Thus answered Johnny in his glory, 
And that was all his travel's story. 

MICHAEL. 


A PASTORAL POEiU. 

If from the public way you turn your steps 
Up the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll, 
You will suppose that with an upright path 
Your feet must struggle ; in such bold ascent 
The pastoral mountains front you, face to face. 
But, courage ! for around that boisterous brool 
The mountains have all opened out themselves. 
And made a hidden valley of their own. 
No habitation can be seen ; but they 
Who journey thither find themselves alone 
With a few sheep, with rocks and stones, and kite 
That overhead are sailing in the sky. 
It is in truth an utter solitude ; 
Nor should I have made mention of this Dell 
But for one object which you might pass by, 
Might see and notice not. Beside the brook 
Appears a straggling heap of unhewn stones ! 
And to that simple object appertains ■ 
A story — unenriched with strange events, 
Yet not unfit, I deem, for the fireside, 
Or for the summer shade. It was the first 
Of those domestic tales that spake to me 
Of Shepherds, dwellers in the valleys, men 
Whom I already loved ; — not verily 
For their own sakes, but for the fields and hills 
Where was their occupation and abode. 
And hence this Tale, while I was yet a Boy 
Careless of books, yet having felt the power 
Of Nature, by the gentle agency 
Of natural objects, led me on to feel 
For passions that were not my own, and think 
(At random and imperfectly indeed) 
On man, the heart of man, and human life. 
Therefore, although it be a history 
Homely and rude, I will relate the same 
For the delight of a few natural hearts ; 
And, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake 
Of youthful Poets, who among these hills 
Will be my second self when I am gone. 
Upon the forest-side in Grasmere Vale 
There dwelt a Shepherd, Michael was his name ; 
An old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb. 
His bodily frame had been from youth to age 
Of an unusual strength : his mind was keen, 
Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs, 
And in his shepherd's calling he was prompt 
And watchful more than ordinary men. 

MICHAEL. 

 

Hence had he learned the meaning of all winds, 
Of blasts of every tone ; and, oftentimes, 
When others heeded not, He heard the South 
Make subterraneous music, like the noise 
Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills. 
The Shepherd, at such warning, of his flock 
Bethought him, and he to himself would say, 
' The winds are now devising work for me ! ' 
And, truly, at all times, the storm, that drives 
The traveller to a shelter, summoned him 
Up to the mountains : he had been alone 
Amid the heart of many thousand mists, 
That came to him, and left him, on the heights. 
So lived he till his eightieth year was past. 
And grossly that man errs, who should suppose 
That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks, 
Were things indifferent to the Shepherd's thoughts. 
Fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed 
The common air ; hills, which with vigorous step 
He had so often climbed ; which had impressed 
So many incidents upon his mind 
Of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear ; 
Which, like a book, preserved the memory 
Of the dumb animals, whom he had saved, 
Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts 
The certainty of honourable gain ; 
Those fields, those hills — what could they less ? 
had laid 
Strong hold on his affections, were to him 
A pleasurable feeling of blind love, 
The pleasure which there is in life itself. 
His days had not been passed in singleness. 
His Helpmate was a comely matron, old — 
Though younger than himself full twenty years. 
She was a woman of a stirring life, 
Whose heart was in her house : two wheels she had 
Of antique form ; this large, for spinning wool ; 
That small, for flax ; and if one wheel had rest 
It was because the other was at work. 
The Pair had but one inmate in their house, 
An only Child, who had been born to them 
When Michael, telling o'er his years, began 
To deem that he was old, — in shepherd's phrase, 
With one foot in the grave. This only Son, 
With two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm, 
The one of an inestimable worth, 
Made all their household. I may truly say, 
That they were as a proverb in the vale 
For endless industry. When day was gone, 
And from their occupations out of doors 
The Son and Father were come home, even then, 
Their labour did not cease ; unless when all 
Turned to the cleanly supper-board, and there, 

Each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk, 
Sat round the basket piled with oaten cakes, 
And their plain home-made cheese. Yet when 
the meal 
Was ended, Luke (for so the Son was named) 
And his old Father both betook themselves 
To such convenient work as might employ 
Their hands by the fire-side ; perhaps to card 
Wool for the Housewife's spindle, or repair 
Some injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe, 
Or other implement of house or field. 
Down from the ceiling, by the chimney's edge, 
That in our ancient uncouth country style 
With huge and black projection overbrowed 
Large space beneath, as duly as the light 
Of day grew dim the Housewife hung a lamp ; 
An aged utensil, which had performed 
Service beyond all others of its kind. 
Early at evening did it burn — and late, 
Surviving comrade of uncounted hours, 
Which, going by from year to year, had found, 
And left the couple neither gay perhaps 
Nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes, 
Living a life of eager industry. 
And now, when Luke had reached his eighteenth 
year, 
There by the light of this old lamp they sate, 
Father and Son, while far into the night 
The Housewife plied her own peculiar work, 
Making the cottage through the silent hours 
Murmur as with the sound of summer flies. 
This light was famous in its neighbourhood, 
And was a public symbol of the life 
That thrifty Pair had lived. For, as it chanced, 
Their cottage on a plot of rising ground 
Stood single, with large prospect, north and south, 
High into Easedale, up to Dunmail-Raise, 
And westward to the village near the lake ; 
And from this constant fight, so regular 
And so far seen, the House itself, by all 
Who dwelt within the limits of the vale, 
Both old and young, was named TheEvening Staji, 
Thus living on through such a length of years, 
The Shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs 
Have loved Ins Helpmate ; but to Michael's heart 
This son of his old age was yet more dear — 
Less from instinctive tenderness, the same 
Fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all — 
Than that a child, more than all other gifts 
That earth can offer to declining man, 
Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts, 
And stirrings of inquietude, when they 

 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

 

By tendency of nature needs must fail. 
Exceeding was the love he bare to him, 
His heart and his heart's joy ! For oftentimes 
Old Michael, while he was a babe in arms, 
Had done him female service, not alone 
For pastime and delight, as is the use 
Of fathers, but with patient mind enforced 
To acts of tenderness ; and he had rocked 
His cradle, as with a woman's gentle hand. 
And, in a later time, ere yet the Bo/ 
Had put on boy's attire, did Michael love, 
Albeit of a stern unbending mind, 
To have the Young-one in his sight, when he 
Wrought in the field, or on his shepherd's stool 
Sate with a fettered sheep before him stretched 
Under the large old oak, that near his door 
Stood single, and, from matchless depth of shade, 
Chosen for the Shearer's covert from the sun, 
Thence in our rustic dialect was called 
The Clipping Tree , a name which yet it bears. 
There, while they two were sitting in the shade, 
With others round them, earnest all and blithe, 
Would Michael exercise his heart with looks 
Of fond correction and reproof bestowed 
Upon the Child, if he disturbed the sheep 
By catching at their legs, or with his shouts 
Scared them, while they lay still beneath the shears. 
And when by Heaven'sgood grace theboy grew up 
A healthy Lad, and carried in his cheek 
Two steady roses that were five years old ; 
Then Michael from a winter coppice cut 
With his own hand a sapling, which he hooped 
With iron, making it throughout in all 
Due requisites a perfect shepherd's staff, 
And gave it to the Boy ; wherewith equipt 
He as a watchman oftentimes was placed 
At gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock ; 
And, to his office prematurely called, 
There stood the urchin, as you will divine, 
Something between a hindrance and a help ; 
And for this cause not always, I believe, 
Receiving from his Father hire of praise ; 
Though nought was left undone which staff, or 
voice, 
Or looks, or threatening gestures, could perform. 
But soon as Luke, full ten years old, could stand 
Against the mountain blasts ; and to the heights, 
Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways, 

 Clipping is the word used in the North of England for 
shearing. 

He with his Father daily went, and they 
Were as companions, why should I relate 
That objects which the Shepherd loved before 
Were dearer now  that from the Boy there came 
Feelings and emanations — things which were 
Light to the sun and music to the wind; 
And that the old Man's heart seemed born again ? 
Thus in his Father's sight the Boy grew up : 
And now, when he had reached his eighteenth year, 
He was his comfort and his daily hope. 
While in this sort the simple household lived 
From day to day, to Michael's ear there came 
Distressful tidmgs. Long before the time 
Of which I speak, the Shepherd had been bound 
In surety for his brother's son, a man 
Of an industrious life, and ample means ; 
But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly 
Had prest upon him ; and old Michael now 
Was summoned to discharge the forfeiture, 
A grievous penalty, but httle less 
Than half his substance. This unlooked-for claim, 
At the first hearing, for a moment took 
More hope out of his life than he supposed 
That any old man ever could have lost. 
As soon as he had armed himself with strength 
To look his trouble in the face, it seemed 
The Shepherd's sole resource to sell at once 
A portion of his patrimonial fields. 
Such was his first resolve ; he thought again, 
And Ms heart failed him. " Isabel," said he, 
Two evenings after he had heard the news, 
" I have been toiling more than seventy years, 
And in the open sunshine of God's love 
Have we all lived ; yet if these fields of ours 
Should pass into a stranger's hand, I think 
That I could not lie quiet in my grave. 
Our lot is a hard lot ; the sun himself 
Has scarcely been more diligent than I ; 
And I have lived to be a fool at last 
To my own family. An evil man 
That was, and made an evil choice, if he 
Were false to us ; and if he were not false, 
There are ten thousand to whom loss like this 
Had been no sorrow. I forgive him ; — but 
'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus. 
When I began, my purpose was to speak 
Of remedies and of a cheerful hope. 
Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel ; the land 
Shall not go from us, and it shall be free ; 
He shall possess it, free as is the wind 
That passes over it. We have, thou know'st, 

MICHAEL. 

.') 

Another kinsman — he will be our friend 
In this distress. He is a prosperous man, 
Thriving in trade — and Luke to him shall go, 
And with his kinsman's help and his own thrift 
He quickly will repair this loss, and then 
He may return to us. If here he stay, 
What can be done  Where every one is poor, 
What can be gained ? " 
At this the old Man paused, 
And Isabel sat silent, for her mind 
Was busy, looking back into past times. 
There 's Richard Bateman, thought she to herself, 
He was a parish-boy — at the church-door 
They made a gathering for him, shillings, pence 
And halfpennies, wherewith the neighbours bought 
A basket, which they filled with pedlar's wares ; 
And, with this basket on his arm, the lad 
Went up to London, found a master there, 
Who, out of many, chose the trusty boy 
To go and overlook his merchandise 
Beyond the seas ; where he grew wondrous rich, 
And left estates and monies to the poor  , 
And, at his birth-place, built a chapel floored 
With marble, which he sent from foreign lands. 
These thoughts, and many others of like sort, 
Passed quickly through the mind of Isabel, 
And her face brightened. The old Man was glad, 
And thus resumed : — Well, Isabel ! this scheme 
These two days, has been meat and drink to me. 
Far more than we have lost is left us yet. 
■ — We have enough— I wish indeed that I 
Were younger ;— but this hope is a good hope. 
— Make ready Luke's best garments, of the best 
Buy for him more, and let us send him forth 
To-morrow, or the next day, or to-night : 
—If he could go, the Boy should go to-night." 
Here Michael ceased, and to the fields went forth 
With a light heart. The Housewife for five days 
Was restless morn and night, and all day long 
Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare 
Things needful for the journey of her son. 
But Isabel was glad when Sunday came 
To stop her in her work : for, when she lay 
By Michael's side, she through the last two nights 
Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep : 
And when they rose at morning she could see 
That all his hopes were gone. That day at noon 
She said to Luke, while they two by themselves 
Were sitting at the door, " Thou must not go : 
We have no other Child but thee to lose, 
None to remember — do not go away, 
For if thou leave thy Father he will die." 
The Youth made answer with a jocund voice ; 

And Isabel, when she had told her fears, 
Recovered heart. That evening her best fare 
Did she bring forth, and all together sat 
Like happy people round a Christmas fire. 
With daylight Isabel resumed her work ; 
And all the ensuing week the house appeared 
As cheerful as a grove in Spring : at length 
The expected letter from their kinsman came, 
With kind assurances that he would do 
His utmost for the welfare of the Boy ; 
To which, requests were added, that forthwith 
He might be sent to him. Ten times or more 
The letter was read over ; Isabel 
Went forth to show it to the neighbours round ; 
Nor was there at that time on English land 
A prouder heart than Luke's. When Isabel 
Had to her house returned, the old Man said, 
" He shall depart to-morrow." To this word 
The Housewife answered, talking much of things 
Which, if at such short notice he should go, 
Would surely be forgotten. But at length 
She gave consent, and Michael was at ease. 
Near the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll, 
In that deep vaUey, Michael had designed 
To build a Sheep-fold ; and, before he heard 
The tidings of his melancholy loss, 
For this same purpose he had gathered up 
A heap of stones, which by the streamlet's edge 
Lay thrown together, ready for the work. 
With Luke that evening thitherward he walked : 
And soon as they had reached the place he stopped, 
And thus the old Man spake to him : — " My Son, 
To-morrow thou wilt leave me : with full heart. 
I look upon thee, for thou art the same 
That wert a promise to me ere thy birth, 
And all thy life hast been my daily joy. 
I will relate to thee some little part 
Of our two histories ; 'twill do thee good 
When thou art from me, even if I should touch 
On things thou canst not know of. After thou 
First cam'st into the world — as oft befals 
To new-born infants — thou didst sleep away 
Two days, and blessings from thy Father's tongue 
Then fell upon thee. Day by day passed on, 
And still I loved thee with increasing love. 
Never to living ear came sweeter sounds 
Than when I heard thee by our own fire-side 
First uttering, without words, a natural tune ; 
While thou, a feeding babe, didst hi thy joy 
Sing at thy Mother's breast. Month followed month, 
And in the open fields my life was passed 
And on the mountains ; else I think that thou 

 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

Hadst been brought up upon thy Father's knees. 
But we were playmates, Luke : among these hills, 
As well thou knowest, in us the old and young 
Have played together, nor with me didst thou 
Lack any pleasure which a boy can know." 
Luke had a manly heart ; but at these words 
He sobbed aloud. The old Man grasped his hand, 
And said, " Nay, do not take it so — I see 
That these are things of which I need not speak. 
— Even to the utmost I have been to thee 
A kind and a good Father : and herein 
I but repay a gift which I myself 
Received at others' hands ; for, though now old 
Beyond the common life of man, I still 
Remember them who loved me in my youth. 
Both of them sleep together : here they lived, 
As all their Forefathers had done ; and when 
At length their time was come, they were not loth 
To give their bodies to the family mould. 
I wished that thou shouldst live the life they lived : 
But, 'tis a long time to look back, my Son, 
And see so little gain from threescore years. 
These fields were burthened when they came to me ; 
Till I was forty years of age, not more 
Than half of my inheritance was mine. 
I toiled and toiled ; God blessed me in my work, 
And till these three weeks past the land was free. 
— It looks as if it never could endure 
Another Master. Heaven forgive me, Luke, 
If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good 
That thou should'st go." 
At this the old Man paused ; 
Then, pointing to the stones near which they stood, 
Thus, after a short silence, he resumed : 
" This was a work for us ; and now, my Son, 
It is a work for me. But, lay one stone — 
Here, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands. 
Nay, Boy, be of good hope ; — we both may live 
To see a better ay. At eighty-four 
I still am strong and hale ; — do thou thy part ; 
I will do mine. — I will begin again 
With many tasks that were resigned to thee : 
Up to the heights, and in among the storms, 
Will I without thee go again, and do 
All works which I was wont to do alone, 
Before I knew thy face. — Heaven bless thee, Boy ! 
Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast 
With many hopes ; it should be so — yes — yes — 
I knew that tbou could'st never have a wish 
To leave me, Luke : thou hast been bound to me 
Only by links of love : when thou art gone, 
What will be left to us !— But, I forget 
My purposes. Lay now the corner-stone, 
As I requested ; and hereafter, Luke, 

When thou art gone away, should evil men 
Be thy companions, think of me, my Son, 
And of this moment ; hither turn thy thoughts, 
And God will strengthen thee : amid all fear 
And all temptation, Luke, I pray that thou 
May'st bear in mind the life thy Fathers lived, 
Who, being innocent, did for that cause 
Bestir them in good deeds. Now, fare thee well — 
When thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see 
A work which is not here : a covenant 
'Twill be between us ; but, whatever fate 
Befal thee, I shall love thee to the last, 
And bear thy memory with me to the grave." 
The Shepherd ended here ; and Luke stooped 
down, 
And, as his Father had requested, laid 
The first stone of the Sheep-fold. At the sight 
The old Man's grief broke from him ; to his heart 
He pressed his Son, he kissed him and wept ; 
And to the house together they returned. 
— Hushed was that House in peace, or seeming 
peace, 
Ere the night fell : — with morrow's dawn the Boy 
Began his journey, and when he had reached 
The public way, he put on a bold face ; 
And all the neighbours, as he passed their doors, 
Came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers, 
That followed him till he was out of sight. 
A good report did from their Kinsman come, 
Of Luke and his well-doing : and the Boy 
Wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news, 
Which, as the Housewife phrased it, were throughout 
' The prettiest letters that were ever seen.' 
Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts. 
So, many months passed on : and once again 
The Shepherd went about his daily work 
With confident and cheerful thoughts ; and now 
Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour 
He to that valley took his way, and there 
Wrought at the Sheep-fold. Meantime Luke began 
To slacken in his duty ; and, at length, 
He in the dissolute city gave himself 
To evil courses : ignominy and shame 
Fell on him, so that he was driven at last 
To seek a hiding-place beyond the seas. 
There is a comfort in the strength of love ; 
'Twill make a thing endurable, which else 
Would overset the brain, or break the heart : 
I have conversed with more than one who well 
Remember the old Man, and what he was 
Years after he had heard this heavy news. 

THE WIDOW ON V/INDERMERE SIDE. 

 ! 

His bodily frame had been from youth to age 
Of an unusual strength. Among the rocks 
He went, and still looked up to sun and cloud, 
And listened to the wind ; and, as before, 
Performed all kinds of labour for his sheep, 
And for the land, his small inheritance. 
And to that hollow dell from time to time 
Did he repair, to build the Fold of which 
His flock had need. 'Tis not forgotten yet 
The pity which was then in every heart 
For the old Man — and 'tis believed by all 
That many and many a day he thither went, 
And never lifted up a single stone. 
There, by the Sheep-fold, sometimes was he 
seen 
Sitting alone, or with his faithful Dog, 
Then old, beside him, lying at his feet. 
The length of full seven years, from time to time, 
He at the building of this Sheep-fold wrought, 
And left the work unfinished when he died. 
Three years, or little more, did Isabel 
Survive her Husband : at her death the estate 
Was sold, and went into a stranger's hand. 
The Cottage which was named the Evening Star 
Is gone — the ploughshare has been through the 
ground 
On which it stood ; great changes have been wrought 
In all the neighbourhood : — yet the oak is left 
That grew beside their door ; and the remains 
Of the unfinished Sheep-fold may be seen 
Beside the boisterous brook of Green-head Ghyll. 
. 

THE WIDOW ON WINDERMERE SIDE, 
r. 
How beautiful when up a lofty height 
Honour ascends among the humblest poor, 
And feeling sinks as deep ! See there the door 
Of One, a Widow, left beneath a weight 
Of blameless debt. On evil Fortune's spite 
She wasted no complaint, but strove to make 
A just repayment, both for conscience-sake 
| And that herself and hers should stand upright 
! In the world's eye. Her work when daylight failed 
| Paused not, and through the depth of night she kept 
| Such earnest vigils, that belief prevailed 
With some, the noble Creature never slept ; 
But, one by one, the hand of death assailed 
Her children from her inmost heart bewept, 

The Mother mourned, nor ceased her tears to flow, 
Till a winter's noon-day placed her buried Son 
Before her eyes, last child of many gone — 
His raiment of angelic white, and lo ! 
His very feet bright as the dazzling snow 
Which they are touching ; yea far brighter, even 
As that which comes, or seems to come, from heaven, 
Surpasses aught these elements can show. 
Much she rejoiced, trusting that from that hour 
Whate'er befel she could not grieve or pine ; 
But the Transfigured, in and out of season, 
Appeared, and spiritual presence gained a power 
Over material forms that mastered reason. 
OIi, gracious Heaven, in pity make her thine ! 
hi. 
But why that prayer  as if to her could come 
No good but by the way that leads to bliss 
Through Death, — so judging we should judge amiss. 
Since reason failed want is her threatened doom, 
Yet frequent transports mitigate the gloom : 
Nor of those maniacs is she one that kiss 
The air or laugh upon a precipice ; 
No, passing through strange sufferings toward the 
tomb 
She smiles as if a martyr's crown were won : 
Oft, when light breaks through clouds or waving 
trees, 
With outspread arms and fallen upon her knees 
The Mother hails in her descending Son 
An Angel, and in earthly ecstacies 
Her own angelic glory seems begun. 

THE ARMENIAN LADY'S LOVE. 
[The subject of the following poem is from the Orlandus 
of the author's friend, Kenelm Henry Digby: and the 
liberty is taken of inscribing it to him as an acknowledg- 
ment, however unworthy, of pleasure and instruction 
derived from his numerous and valuable writings, 
illustrative of the piety and chivalry of the olden time.] 

You have heard ' a Spanish Lady 
How she wooed an English man ;' 
Hear now of a fair Armenian, 
Daughter of the proud Soldan ; 
How she loved a Christian Slave, and told her pain 
By word, look, deed, with hope that he might love 
again. 

 See, in Percy's Reliqnes, that fine old ballad, "The 
Spanish Lady's Love;" from which Poem the form of 
stanza, as suitable to dialogue, is adopted.

" Pluck that rose, it moves my liking," 
Said she, lifting up her veil ; 
" Pluck it for me, gentle gardener, 
Ere it wither and grow pale." 
" Princess fair, I till the ground, hut may not take 
From twig or hed an humbler flower, even for 
your sake !" 

•"< Grieved am I, submissive Christian ! 
To behold thy captive state ; 
Women, in your land, may pity 
(May they not?) the unfortunate." 
" Yes, kind Lady ! otherwise man could not bear 
Life, which to every one that breathes is full of 
care." 

" Worse than idle is compassion 
If it end in tears and sighs ; 
Thee from bondage would I rescue 
And from vile indignities ; 
Nurtured, as thy mien bespeaks, in high degree, 
Look up — and help a hand that longs to set thee 
free." 

" Lady ! dread the wish, nor venture 
In such peril to engage ; 
Think how it would stir against you 
Your most loving father's rage : 
Sad deliverance would it be, and yoked with shame, 
Should troubles overflow on her from whom it 

" Generous Frank ! the just in effort 
Are of inward peace secure : 
Hardships for the brave encountered, 
Even the feeblest may endure : 
If almighty grace through me thy chains unbind 
My father for slave's work may seek a slave in 
mind." 

" Princess, at this burst of goodness, 
My long-frozen heart grows warm ! " 
'•'■ Yet you make all courage fruitless, 
Me to save from chance of harm : 
Leading such companion I that gilded dome, 
Yon minarets, would gladly leave for his worst 
home." 

•'< Feeling tunes your voice, fair Princess ! 
And your brow is free from scorn, 
Else these words would come like mockery, 
Sharper than the pointed thorn." 
" Whence the undeserved mistrust ? Too wide apart 
Our faith hath been, — O would that eyes could see 
the heart ! " 

" Tempt me not, I pray ; my doom is 
These base implements to wield ; 
Rusty lance, I ne'er shall grasp thee, 
Ne'er assoil my cobwebb'd shield ! 
Never see my native land, nor castle towers, 
Nor Her who thinking of me there counts widowed 
hours." 

" Prisoner ! pardon youthful fancies ; 
Wedded ? If you can, say no ! 
Blessed is and be your consort ; 
Hopes I cherished — let them go ! 
Handmaid's privilege would leave my purpose free, 
Without another link to my felicity." 

" Wedded love with loyal Christians, 
Lady, is a mystery rare ; 
Body, heart, and soul in union, 
Make one being of a pair." 
u Humble love in me would look for no return, 
Soft as a guiding star that cheers, but cannot burn." 



" Gracious Allah ! by such title 
Do I dare to thank the God, 
Him who thus exalts thy spirit, 
Flower of an unchristian sod ! 
Or hast thou put off wings which thou in heaven 
dost wear ? 
What have I seen, and heard, or dreamt ? where 
am I ? where ? " 

Here broke off the dangerous converse : 
Less impassioned words might tell 
How the pair escaped together, 
Tears not wanting, nor a knell 
Of sorrow in her heart while through her father's 
door, 
And from her narrow world, she passed for ever- 
more.

Say not you love a roasted fowl,

When evening dews begin to fall.

THE REDBREAST. 

 

A pair of herons oft-times have I seen, 
Upon a rocky islet, side by side, 
Drying their feathers in the mn, at ease ; 
And so, when night with grateful gloom had fallen, 
Two glow-worms in such nearness that they shared, 
As seemed, their soft self-satisfying light, 
Each with the other, on the dewy ground, 
Where He that made them blesses their repose. — 
When wandering among lakes and hills I note, 
Once more, those creatures thus by nature paired, 
And guarded in their tranquil state of life, 
Even, as your happy presence to my mind 
Their union brought, will they repay the debt, 
And send a thankful spirit back to you, 
With hope that we, dear Friends ! shall meet again. 

THE REDBREAST. 
(SUGGESTED IN A WESTMORELAND COTTAGE.) 
Driven in by Autumn's sharpening air 
From half-stripped woods and pastures bare, 
Brisk Robin seeks a kindlier Home : 
Not like a beggar is he come, 
But enters as a looked-for guest, 
Confiding in his ruddy breast, 
As if it were a natural shield 
Charged with a blazon on the field, 
Due to that good and pious deed 
Of which we in the Ballad read. 
But pensive fancies putting by, 
And wild-wood sorrows, speedily 
He plays the expert ventriloquist ; 
And, caught by glimpses now — now missed, 
Puzzles the listener with a doubt 
If the soft voice he throws about 
Comes from within doors or without ! 
Was ever such a sweet confusion, 
Sustained by delicate illusion ? 
He 's at your elbow — to your feeling 
The notes are from the floor or ceiling ; 
And there 's a riddle to be guessed, 
"Till you have marked his heaving chest, 
And busy throat whose sink and swell, 
Betray the Elf that loves to dwell 
In Robin's bosom, as a chosen cell. 
Heart-pleased we smile upon the Bird 
If seen, and with like pleasure stirred 
Commend him, when he's only heard. 

But small and fugitive our gain 
Compared with hers who long hath lain, 
With languid limbs and patient head 
Reposing on a lone sick-bed ; 
Where now, she daily hears a strain 
That cheats her of too busy cares, 
Eases her pain, and helps her prayers. 
And who but this dear Bird beguiled 
The fever of that pale-faced Child ; 
Now cooling, with his passing wing, 
Her forehead, like a breeze of Spring : 
Recalling now, with descant soft 
Shed round her pillow from aloft, 
Sweet thoughts of angels hovering nigh, 
And the invisible sympathy 
Of 'Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and John, 
Blessing the bed she lies upon % ' 
And sometimes, just as listening ends 
In slumber, with the cadence blends 
A dream of that low-warbled hymn 
Which old folk, fondly pleased to trim 
Lamps of faith, now burning dim, 
Say that the Cherubs carved in stone, 
When clouds gave way at dead of night 
And the ancient church was filled with light, 
Used to sing in heavenly tone, 
Above and round the sacred places 
They guard, with winged baby-faces. 
Thrice happy Creature ! in all lands 
Nurtured by hospitable hands : 
Free entrance to this cot has he, 
Entrance and exit both yet free ; 
And, when the keen unruffled weather 
That thus brings man and bird together, 
Shall with its pleasantness be past, 
And casement closed and door made fast, 
To keep at bay the howling blast, 
He needs not fear the season's rage, 
For the whole house is Robin's cage. 
Whether the bird flit here or there, 
O'er table lilt, or perch on chair, 
Though some may frown and make a stir, 
To scare him as a trespasser, 
And he belike will flinch or start, 
Good friends he has to take his part ; 
One chiefly, who with voice and look 
Pleads for him from the chimney-nook, 
Where sits the Dame, and wears away 

 The words — 
' Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and John, 
Bless the bed that I lie on,' 
are part of a child's prayer, still in general use through 
the northern counties.

Her long and vacant holiday ; 
With images about her heart, 
Reflected from the years gone by, 
On human nature's second infancy.

HER EYES ARE WILD. 
i. 
Her eyes are wild, her head is bare, 
The sun has burnt her coal-black hair 
Her eyebrows have a rusty stain, 
And she came far from over the main. 
She has a baby on her arm, 
Or else she were alone : 
And underneath the hay-stack warm, 
And on the greenwood stone, 
She talked and sung the woods among, 
And it was in the English tongue. 

" Sweet babe ! they say that I am mad, 
But nay, my heart is far too glad ; 
And I am happy when I sing 
Full many a sad and doleful thing : 
Then, lovely baby, do not fear ! 
I pray thee have no fear of me ; 
But safe as in a cradle, here 
My lovely baby ! thou shalt be : 
To thee I know too much I owe ; 
I cannot work thee any woe. 

A fire was once within my brain ; 
And in my head a dull, dull pain ; 
And fiendish faces, one, two, three, 
Hung at my breast, and pulled at me ; 
But then there came a sight of joy ; 
It came at once to do me good ; 
I waked, and saw my little boy, 
My little boy of flesh and blood ; 
Oh joy for me that sight to see ! 
For he was here, and only he. 

Suck, little babe, oh suck again ! 
It cools my blood ; it cools my brain ; 
Tby lips I feel them, baby ! they 
Draw from my heart the pain away. 
Oh ! press me with thy little hand ; 
It loosens something at my chest ; 

About that tight and deadly band 
I feel thy little fingers prest. 
The breeze I see is in the tree : 
It comes to cool my babe and me. 

Oh ! love me, love me, little boy ! 
Thou art thy mother's only joy ; 
And do not dread the waves below, 
When o'er the sea-rock's edge we go ; 
The high crag cannot work me harm, 
Nor leaping torrents when they howl ; 
The babe I carry on my arm, 
He saves for me my precious soul ; 
Then happy he ; for blest am I ; 
Without me my sweet babe would die. 

Then do not fear, my boy ! for thee 
Bold as a lion will I be ; 
And I will always be thy guide, 
Through hollow snows and rivers wide. 
I ' build an Indian bower ; I know 
The leaves that make the softest bed : 
And, if from me thou wilt not go, 
But still be true till I am dead, 
My pretty thing ! then thou shalt sing 
As merry as the birds in spring. 

Thy father cares not for my breast, 
'Tis thine, sweet baby, there to rest ; 
'Tis all thine own ! — and, if its hue 
Be changed, that was so fair to view, 
Tis fair enough for thee, my dove ! 
My beauty, little child, is flown, 
But thou wilt live with me in love ; 
And what if my poor cheek be brown ? 
'Tis well for me, thou canst not see 
How pale and wan it else would be. 

Dread not their taunts, my little Life ; 
I am thy father's wedded wife ; 
And underneath the spreading tree 
We two will live in honesty. 
If his sweet boy he could forsake, 
With me he never would have stayed : 
From him no harm my babe can take ; 
But he, poor man ! is wretched made ; 
And every day we two will pray 
For him that 's gone and far away. 

POEMS FOUNDED ON THE AFFECTIONS. 

 

I ' teach my boy the sweetest things : 
I ' teach him how the owlet sings. 
My little babe ! thy lips are still, 
And thou hast almost sucked thy fill. 
— Where art thou gone, my own dear child ? 
What wicked looks are those I see ? 
Alas ! alas ! that look so wild, 
It never, never came from me : 
If thou art mad, my pretty lad, 
Then I must be for ever sad. 

Oh ! smile on me, my little lamb ! 
For I thy own dear mother am : 
My love for thee has well been tried : 
I 've sought thy father far and wide. 
I know the poisons of the shade ; 
I know the earth-nuts fit for food : 
Then, pretty dear, be not afraid : 
We ' find thy father in the wood. 
Now laugh and be gay, to the woods away ! 
And there, my babe, we ' five for aye."

POEMS ON THE NAMING OF PLACES. 

ADVERTISEMENT. 
By persons resident in the country and attached to rural objects, many places will be found unnamed or of unknown 
names, where little Incidents must have occurred, or feelings been experienced, which will have given to such place 
a private and peculiar interest. From a wish to give some sort of record to such Incidents, and renew the gratification 
of uch feelings, Names have been given to Places by the Author and some of his Friends, and the following Poems 
written in consequence. 

Ix was an April morning : fresh and clear 
The Rivulet, delighting in its strength, 
Ran with a young man's speed ; and yet the voice 
Of waters which the winter had supplied 
Was softened down into a vernal tone. 
The spirit of enjoyment and desire, 
And hopes and wishes, from all living things 
Wont circling, like a multitude of sounds. 
Tlio budding groves seemed eager to urge on 
The steps of June ; as if then' various hues 
Were only hindrances that stood between 
Them and their object : but, meanwhile, prevailed 
Such an entire contentment in the air 
That every naked ash, and tardy tree 
Yet leafless, showed as if the countenance 
With which it looked on this delightful day 
Were native to the summer. — Up the brook 
I roamed in the confusion of my heart. 
Alive to all things and forgetting all. 
At length I to a sudden turning came 
In this continuous glen, where down a rock 
The Stream, so ardent in its course before, 
Sent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all 
Which I till then had heard, appeared the voice 
Of common pleasure : beast and bird, the lamb, 
The shepherd's dog, the linnet and the thrush 
Vied with this waterfall, and made a song, 
Which, while I listened, seemed like the wild growth 
Or like some natural produce of the air, 
That could not cease to be. Green leaves were here ; 
But 'twas the foliage of the rocks — the birch, 
The yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn, 
With hanging islands of resplendent furze : 
And, on a summit, distant a short space, 
By any who should look beyond the dell, 
A single mountain-cottage might be seen. 
I gazed and gazed, and to myself I said, 

" Our thoughts at least are ours ; and this wild nook, 
My Emma, I will dedicate to thee." 
Soon did the spot become my other home, 
My dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode. 
And, of the Shepherds who have seen me there, 
To whom I sometimes in our idle talk 
Have told this fancy, two or three, perhaps, 
Years after we are gone and in our graves, 
When they have cause to speak of this wild place 
May call it by the name of Emma's Dell. 
(. 

TO JOANNA. 

Amid the smoke of cities did you pass 
The time of early youth ; aud there you learned, 
From years of quiet industry, to love 
The living Beings by your own fire-side, 
With such a stroDg devotion, that your heart 
Is slow to meet the sympathies of them 
Who look upon the hills with tenderness, 
And make dear friendships with the streams and 
groves. 
Yet we, who are transgressors in this kind, 
Dwelling retired in our simplicity 
Among the woods and fields, we love you well, 
Joanna ! and I guess, since you have been 
So distant from us now for two long years, 
That you will gladly listen to discourse, 
However trivial, if you thence be taught 
That they, with whom you once were happy, talk 
Familiarly of you and of old times. 
While I was seated, now some ten days past, 
Beneath those lofty firs, that overtop 
Their ancient neighbour, the old steeple-tower, 
The Vicar from his gloomy house hard by 

POEMS ON THE NAMING OF PLACES. 

 

Came forth to greet me ; and when he had asked, 
" How fares Joanna, that wild-hearted Maid ! 
And when will she return to us ?" he paused ; 
And, after short exchange of village news, 
He with grave looks demanded, for what cause, 
Reviving obsolete idolatry, 
I, like a Runic Priest, in characters 
Of formidable size had chiselled out 
Some uncouth name upon the native rock, 
Above the Rotha, by the forest-side. 
— Now, by those dear immunities of heart 
Engendered between malice and true love, 
I was not loth to be so catechised, 
And this was my reply : — " As it befel, 
One summer morning we had walked abroad 
At break of day, Joanna and myself. 
— 'Twas that delightful season when the broom, 
Full- flowered, and visible on every steep, 
Along the copses runs in veins of gold. 
Our pathway led us on to Rotha's banks ; 
And when we came in front of that tall rock 
That eastward looks, I there stopped short — and 
stood 
Tracing the lofty barrier with my eye 
From base to summit ; such delight I found 
To note in shrub and tree, in stone and flower 
That intermixture of delicious hues, 
Along so vast a surface, all at once, 
In one impression, by connecting force 
Of then' own beauty, imaged in the heart. 
— When I had gazed perhaps two minutes' space, 
Joanna, looking in my eyes, beheld 
That ravishment of mine, and laughed aloud. 
The Rock, like something starting from a sleep, 
Took up the Lady's voice, and laughed again ; 
That ancient Woman seated on Helm-crag 
Was ready with her cavern ; Hammar-scar, 
And the tall Steep of Silver-how, sent forth 
A noise of laughter ; southern Loughrigg heard, 
And Fairfield answered with a mountain tone ; 
Helvellyn far into the clear blue sky 
Carried the Lady's voice, — old Skiddaw blew 
His speaking-trumpet ; — back out of the clouds 
Of Glaramara southward came the voice ; 
And Kirkstone tossed it from his misty head. 
— Now whether (said I to our cordial Friend, 
Who in the hey-day of astonishment 
Smiled in my face) this were in simple truth 
A work accomplished by the brotherhood 
Of ancient mountains, or my ear was touched 
With dreams and visionary impulses 
To me alone imparted, sure I am 
That there was a loud uproar in the hills. 
And, while we both were listening, to my side 

The fair Joanna drew, as if she wished 
To shelter from some object of her fear. 
— Andhence.long afterwards, when eighteen moons . 
Were wasted, as I chanced to walk alone 
Beneath this rock, at sunrise, on a calm 
And silent morning, I sat down, and there, 
In memory of affections old and true, 
I chiselled out in those rude characters 
Joanna's name deep in the living stone : — 
And I, and all who dwell by my fireside, 
Have called the lovely rock, Joanna's Rock." 
H. 
Note. — In Cumberland and Westmoreland are several 
Inscriptions, upon the native rock, which, from the wast- 
ing of time, and the rudeness of the workmanship, have 
been mistaken for Runic. They are without doubt Roman. 
The Rotha, mentioned in this poem, is the River which, 
flowing through the lakes of Grasmere and Rydale, falls 
into Wynandermere. On Helmcrag, that impressive single 
mountain at the head of the Vale of Grasmere, is a rock 
which from most points of view bears a striking resem- 
blance to an old Woman cowering. Close by this rock is 
one of those fissures or caverns, which in the language of 
the country are called dungeons. Most of the mountains 
here mentioned immediately surround the Vale of Gras- 
mere ; of the others, some are at a considerable distance, 
but they belong to the same cluster. 

There is an Eminence, — of these our hills 
The last that parleys with the setting sun ; 
We can behold it from our orchard-seat ; 
And, when at evening we pursue our walk 
Along the public way, this Peak, so high 
Above us, and so distant in its height, 
Is visible ; and often seems to send 
Its own deep quiet to restore our hearts. 
The meteors make of it a favourite haunt : 
The star of Jove, so beautiful and large 
In the mid heavens, is never half so fair 
As when he shines above it. 'Tis in truth 
The loneliest place we have among the clouds. 
And She who dwells with me, whom I have loved 
With such communion, that no place on earth 
Can ever be a solitude to me, 
Hath to this lonely Summit given my Name.

A narrow girdle of rough stones and crags, 
A rude and natural causeway, interposed 
Between the water and a winding slope 
Of copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore

POEMS ON THE NAMING OF PLACES. 

Of Grasmere safe in its own privacy : 
And there myself and two beloved Friends, 
One calm September morning, ere the mist 
Had altogether yielded to the sun, 
Sauntered on this retired and difficult way. 
Ill suits the road with one in haste ; but we 
Played with our time ; and, as we strolled along. 
It was our occupation to observe 
Such objects as the waves had tossed ashore — 
Feather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough, 
Each on the other heaped, along the line 
Of the dry wreck. And, in our vacant mood, 
Not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft 
Of dandelion seed or thistle's beard, 
That skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake, 
Suddenly halting now — a lifeless stand ! 
And starting off again with freak as sudden ; 
In all its sportive wanderings, all the while, 
Making report of an invisible breeze 
That was its wings, its chariot, and its horse, 
Its playmate, rather say, its moving soul. 
And often, trifling with a privilege 
Alike indulged to all, we paused, one now, 
And now the other, to point out, perchance 
To pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair 
Either to be divided from the place 
On which it grew, or to be left alone 
To its own beauty. Many such there are, 
Fair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall fern, 
So stately, of the queen Osmunda named ; 
Plant lovelier, in its own retired abode 
On Grasmere's beach, than Naiad by the side 
Of Grecian brook, or Lady of the Mere, 
Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance. 
— So fared we that bright morning : from the fields, 
Meanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy niirth 
Of reapers, men and women, boys and girls. 
Delighted much to listen to those sounds, 
And feeding thus our fancies, we advanced 
Along the indented shore ; when suddenly, 
Through a thin veil of glittering haze was seen 
Before us, on a point of jutting land, 
The tall and upright figure of a Man 
Attired in peasant's garb, who stood alone, 
Angling beside the margin of the lake. 
" Improvident and reckless," we exclaimed, 
" The Man must be, who thus can lose a day 
Of the mid harvest, when the labourer's hire 
Is ample, and some little might be stored 
Wherewith to cheer him in the winter time." 
Thus talking of that Peasant, we approached 
Close to the spot where with his rod and line 
He stood alone ; whereat he turned his head 
To greet us — and we saw a Man worn down 

By sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks 
And wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean 
That for my single self I looked at them, 
Forgetful of the body they sustained. — 
Too weak to labour in the harvest field, 
The Man was using his best skill to gain 
A pittance from the dead unfeeling lake 
That knew not of his wants. I will not say 
What thoughts immediately were ours, nor how 
The happy idleness of that sweet morn, 
With all its lovely images, was changed 
To serious musing and to self-reproach. 
Nor did we fail to see within ourselves 
What need there is to be reserved in speech, 
And temper all our thoughts with charity. 
— Therefore, unwilling to forget that day, 
My Friend, Myself, and She who then received 
The same admonishment, have called the place 
By a memorial name, uncouth indeed 
As e'er by mariner was given to bay 
Or foreland, on a new-discovered coast ; 
And Point Rash-Judgment is the name it bears. 
. 

TO M. H. 

Our walk was far among the ancient trees : 
There was no road, nor any woodman's path ; 
But a thick umbrage — checking the wild growth 
Of weed and sapling, along soft green turf 
Beneath the branches — of itself had made 
A track, that brought us to a slip of lawn, 
And a small bed of water in the woods. 
All round this pool both flocks and herds might drink 
On its firm margin, even as from a well, 
Or some stone-basin which the herdsman's hand 
Had shaped for their refreshment ; nor did sun, 
Or wind from any quarter, ever come, 
But as a blessing to this calm recess, 
This glade of water and this one green field. 
The spot was made by Nature for herself; 
The travellers know it not, and 'twill remain 
Unknown to them ; but it is beautiful ; 
And if a man should plant his cottage near, 
Should sleep beneath the shelter of its trees, 
And blend its waters with his daily meal, 
He would so love it, that in his death-hour 
Its image would survive among his thoughts : 
And. therefore, my sweet Mary, this still Nook, 
With all its beeches, we have named from You ! 
. 

POEMS ON THE NAMING OF PLACES. 

Ill 

When, to the attractions of the busy world, 
Preferring studious leisure, I had chosen 
A habitation in this peaceful Vale, 
Sharp season followed of continual storm 
In deepest winter ; and, from week to week, 
Pathway, and lane, and public road, were clogged 
With frequent showers of snow. Upon a hill 
At a short distance from my cottage, stands 
A stately Fir-grove, whither I was wont 
To hasten, for I found, beneath the roof 
Of that perennial shade, a cloistral place 
Of refuge, with an unincumbered floor. 
Here, in safe covert, on the shallow snow, 
And, sometimes, on a speck of visible earth, 
The redbreast near me hopped ; nor was I loth 
To sympathise with vulgar coppice birds 
That, for protection from the nipping blast, 
Hither repaired. — A single beech-tree grew 
Within this grove of firs ! and, on the fork 
Of that one beech, appeared a thrush's nest ; 
A last year's nest, conspicuously built 
At such small elevation from the ground 
As gave sure sign that they, who in that house 
Of nature and of love had made their home 
Amid the fir-trees, all the summer long 
Dwelt in a tranquil spot. And oftentimes, 
A few sheep, stragglers from some mountain-flock, 
Would watch my motions with suspicious stare, 
From the remotest outskirts of the grove, — 
Some nook where they had made their final stand, 
Huddling together from two fears — the fear 
Of me and of the storm. Full many an hour 
Hei'e did I lose. But in this grove the trees 
Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven 
In such perplexed and intricate array ; 
That vainly did I seek, beneath their stems 
A length of open space, where to and fro 
My feet might move without concern or care ; 
And, baffled thus, though earth from day to day 
Was fettered, and the air by storm disturbed, 
I ceased the shelter to frequent, — and prized, 
Less than I wished to prize, that calm recess. 
The snows dissolved, and genial Spring returned 
To clothe the fields with verdure. Other haunts 
Meanwhile were mine ; till, one bright April day, 
By chance retiring from the glare of noon 
To this forsaken covert, there I found 
A hoary pathway traced between the trees, 
And winding on with such an easy line 
Along a natural opening, that I stood 

Much wondering how I could have sought in vaiD 
For what was now so obvious. To abide, 
For an allotted interval of ease, 
Under my cottage-roof, had gladly come 
From the wild sea a cherished Visitant ; 
And with the sight of this same path — begun, 
Begun and ended, in the shady grove, 
Pleasant conviction flashed upon my mind 
That, to this opportune recess allured, 
He had surveyed it with a finer eye, 
A heart more wakeful ; and had worn the track 
By pacing here, unwearied and alone, 
In that habitual restlessness of foot 
That haunts the Sailor measuring o'er and o'er 
His short domain upon the vessel's deck, 
While she pursues her course through the dreary sea. 
When thou hadst quitted Esthwaite's pleasant 
shore, 
And taken thy first leave of those green hills 
And rocks that were the play-ground of thy youth, 
Year followed year, my Brother ! and we two, 
Conversing not, knew little in what mould 
Each other's mind was fashioned ; and at length, 
When once again we met in Grasmere Vale, 
Between us there was little other bond 
Than common feelings of fraternal love. 
But thou, a School-boy, to the sea hadst carried 
Undying recollections ; Nature there 
Was with thee ; she, who loved us both, she still 
Was with thee ; and even so didst thou become 
A silent Poet ; from the solitude 
Of the vast sea didst bring a watchful heart 
Still couchant, an inevitable ear, 
And an eye practised like a blind man's touch. 
— Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone ; 
Nor from this vestige of thy musing hours 
Could I withhold thy honoured name, — and now 
I love the fir-grove with a perfect love. 
Thither do I withdraw when cloudless suns 
Shine hot, or wind blows troublesome and strong ; 
And there I sit at evening, when the steep 
Of Silver-how, and Grasmere's peaceful lake, 
And ope green island, gleam between the stems 
Of the dark firs, a visionary scene ! 
And, while I gaze upon the spectacle 
Of clouded splendour, on this dream-like sight 
Of solemn loveliness, I think on thee, 
My Brother, and on all which thou hast lost. 
Nor seldom, if I rightly guess, while Thou, 
Muttering the verses which I muttered first 
Among the mountains, through the midnight watch 
Art pacing thoughtfully the vessel's deck 
In some far region, here, while o'er my head, 

 

POEMS ON THE NAMING OF PLACES. 

A.t every impulse of the moving breeze, 
The fir-grove murmurs with a sea-like sound, 
Alone I tread this path ; — for aught I know, 
Timing my steps to thine ; and, with a store 
Of undistinguishable sympathies, 
Mingling most earnest wishes for the day 
When we, and others whom we love, shall meet 
A second time, in Grasmere's happy Vale. 
. 
Note This wish was not granted ; the lamented Person 
not long after perished by shipwreck, in discharge of his 
duty as Commander of the Honourable East India Com- 
pany's Vessel, the Earl of Abergavenny. 

Forth from a jutting ridge, around whose base 
Winds our deep Vale, two heath-clad Rocks ascend 
In fellowship, the loftiest of the pair 
Rising to no ambitious height; yet both, 
O'er lake and stream, mountain and flowery mead, 
Unfolding prospects fair as human eyes 

Ever beheld. Up-led with mutual help, 
To one or other brow of those twin Peaks 
Were two adventurous Sisters wont to climb, 
And took no note of the hour while thence the 
gazed, 
The blooming heath their couch, gazed, side 
side, 
In speechless admiration. I, a witness 
And frequent sharer of their calm delight 
With thankful heart, to either Eminence 
Gave the baptismal name each Sister bore. 
Now are they parted, far as Death's cold hand 
Hath power to part the Spirits of those who love 
As they did love. Ye kindred Pinnacles — 
That, while the generations of mankind 
Follow each other to their hiding-place 
In time's abyss, are privileged to endure 
Beautiful in yourselves, and richly graced 
With like command of beauty — grant your aid 
For Mary's humble, Sarah's silent, claim, 
That their pure joy in nature may survive 
From age to age in blended memory.

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

A MORNING EXERCISE. 
Fancy, who leads the pastimes of the glad, 
Full oft is pleased a wayward dart to throw ; 
Sending sad shadows after things not sad, 
Peopling the harmless fields with signs of woe : 
Beneath her sway, a simple forest cry 
Becomes an echo of man's misery. 
Blithe ravens croak of death ; and when the owl 
Tries his two voices for a favourite strain — ■ 
Tu-whit — Tu-whoo! the unsuspecting fowl 
Forebodes mishap or seems but to complain ; 
Fancy, intent to harass and annoy, 
Can thus pervert the evidence of joy. 
Through border wilds where naked Indians stray, 
Myriads of notes attest her subtle skill ; 
A feathered task-master cries, "Work away ! " 
And, in thy iteration, u Whip poor Will ! " 
Is heard the spirit of a toil-worn slave, 
Lashed out of life, not cpiiet in the grave. 
What wonder ? at her bidding, ancient lays 
Steeped in dire grief the voice of Philomel ; 
And that fleet messenger of summer days, 
The Swallow, twittered subject to like spell ; 
But ne'er could Fancy bend the buoyant Lark 
To melancholy service — hark ! hark ! 
The daisy sleeps upon the dewy lawn, 
Not lifting yet the head that evening bowed ; 
But He is risen, a later star of dawn, 
GUttering and twinkling near yon rosy cloud ; 
Bright gem instinct with music, vocal spark ; 
The happiest bird that sprang out of the Ark ! 
Hail, blest above all kinds ! — Supremely skilled 
j Restless with fixed to balance, high with low, 
: Thou leav'st the halcyon free her hopes to build 
j On such forbearance as the deep may show ; 
! Perpetual flight, unchecked by earthly ties, 
Leav'st to the wandering bird of paradise. 

Faithful, though swift as lightning, the meek do ve ; 
Yet more hath Nature reconciled in thee ; 
So constant with thy downward eye of love, 
Yet, in aerial singleness, so free ; 
So humble, yet so ready to rejoice 
In power of wing and never-wearied voice. 
To the last point of vision, and beyond, 
Mount, daring warbler ! — that love-prompted strain, 
('Twixt thee and thine a never-failing bond) 
Thrills not the less the bosom of the plain : 
Yet might'st thou seem, proud privilege ! to sing 
All independent of the leafy spring. 
How would it please old Ocean to partake, 
With sailors longing for a breeze in vain, 
The harmony thy notes most gladly make 
Where earth resembles most his own domain ! 
Urania's self might welcome with pleased ear 
These matins mounting towards her native sphere. 
Chanter by heaven attracted, whom no bars 
To day-light known deter from that pursuit, 
'Tis well that some sage instinct, when the stars 
Come forth at evening, keeps Thee still and mute ; 
For not an eyelid could to sleep incline 
Wert thou among them, singing as they shine !

A FLOWER GARDEN, 
AT COLEOBTON HALL, LEICESTERSHIRE. 
Tell me, ye Zephyrs ! that unfold, 
While fluttering o'er this gay Recess, 
Pinions that fanned the teeming mould 
Of Eden's blissful wilderness, 
Did only softly-stealing hours 
There close the peaceful lives of flowers \ 
Say, when the moving creatures saw 
All kinds commingled without fear, 
Prevailed a like indulgent law 
For the still growths that prosper here ? 
Did wanton fawn and kid forbear 
The half-blown rose, the lily spare ? 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

Or peeped they often from their beds 
And prematurely disappeared, 
Devoured like pleasure ere it spreads 
A bosom to the sun endeared ? 
If such then.' harsh untimely doom, 
It falls not here on bud or bloom. 
All summer-long the happy Eve 
Of this fair Spot her flowers may bind, 
Nor e'er, with ruffled fancy, grieve, 
From the next glance she casts, to find 
That love for little things by Fate 
Is rendered vain as love for great. 
Yet, where the guardian fence is wound, 
So subtly are our eyes beguiled 
We see not nor suspect a bound, 
No more than in some forest wild ; 
The sight is free as ah' — or crost 
Only by art in nature lost. 
And, though the jealous turf refuse 
By random footsteps to be prest, 
And feed on never-sullied dews, 
Ye, gentle breezes from the west, 
With all the ministers of hope 
Are tempted to this sunny slope ! 
And hither throngs of birds resort ; 
Some, inmates lodged in shady nests, 
Some, perched on stems of stately port 
That nod to welcome transient guests ; 
While hare and leveret, seen at play, 
Appear not more shut out than they. 
Apt emblem (for reproof of pride) 
This delicate Enclosure shows 
Of modest kindness, that would hide 
The firm protection she bestows ; 
Of manners, like its viewless fence, 
Ensuring peace to innocence. 
Thus spake the moral Muse — her wing 
Abruptly spreading to depart, 
She left that farewell offering, 
Memento for some docile heart ; 
That may respect the good old age 
When Fancy was Truth's willing Page ; 
And Truth would skim the flowery glade, 
Though entering but as Fancy's Shade. 
. 

A whirl-blast from behind the hill 
Rushed o'er the wood with startling sound ; 
Then — all at once the air was still, 
And showers of hailstones pattered round. 
Where leafless oaks towered high above, 
I sat within an undergrove 
Of tallest hollies, tall and green ; 
A fairer bower was never seen. 
From year to year the spacious floor 
With withered leaves is covered o'er, 
And all the year the bower is green. 
But see ! where'er the hailstones drop 
The withered leaves all skip and hop ; 
There's not a breeze — no breath of air- 
Yet here, and there, and every where 
Along the floor, beneath the shade 
By those embowering hollies made, 
The leaves in myriads jump and spring, 
As if with pipes and music rare 
Some Robin Good-fellow were there, 
And all those leaves, in festive glee, 
Wei'e dancing to the minstrelsy. 

THE WATERFALL AND THE EGLANTINE. 
i. 
" Begone, thou fond presumptuous Elf," 
Exclaimed an angry Voice, 
" Nor dare to thrust thy foolish self 
Between me and my choice !" 
A small Cascade fresh swoln with snows 
Thus threatened a poor Briaivrose, 
That, all bespattered with his foam, 
And dancing high and dancing low, 
Was living, as a child might know, 
In an unhappy home. 

"Dost thou presume my course to block? 
Off, off ! or, puny Thing ! 
I ' hurl thee headlong with the rock 
To which thy fibres cling." 
The Flood was tyrannous and strong ; 
The patient Briar suffered long, 
Nor did he utter groan or sigh, 
Hoping the danger would be past ; 
But, seeing no relief, at last, 
He ventured to reply. 


POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

 

"Ah !" said the Briar, "blame me not ; 
Why should we dwell in strife ? 
We who in this sequestered spot 
Once lived a happy life ! 
You stirred me on my rocky bed — 
What pleasure through my veins you spread 
The summer long, from day to day, 
My leaves you freshened and bedewed ; 
Nor was it common gratitude 
That did your cares repay. 

When spring came on with bud and bell, 
Among these rocks did I 
Before you hang my wreaths to tell 
That gentle days were nigh ! 
And in the sultry summer hours, 
I sheltered you with leaves and flowers ; 
And in my leaves — now shed and gone, 
The linnet lodged, and for us two 
Chanted his pretty songs, when you 
Had little voice or none. 

But now proud thoughts are in your breast — 
What grief is mine you see, 
Ah ! would you think , even yet how blest 
Together we might be ! 
Though of both leaf and flower bereft, 
Some ornaments to me are left — 
Rich store of scarlet hips is mine, 
With which I, in my humble way, 
Would deck you many a winter day, 
A happy Eglantine ! " 
VI. 
What more he said I cannot tell, 
The Torrent clown the rocky dell 
Came thundering loud and fast ; 
I listened, nor aught else could hear ; 
The Briar quaked — and much I fear 
Those accents were his last. 

THE OAK AND THE BROOM. 
A TASTORAL. 
r. 
His simple truths did Andrew glean 
Beside the babbling rills ; 
A careful student he had been 
Among the woods and hills. 

One winter's night, when through the trees 
The wind was roaring, on his knees 
His yoimgest born did Andrew hold : 
And while the rest, a ruddy quire, 
Were seated round their blazing fire, 
This Tale the Shepherd told. 

" I saw a crag, a lofty stone 
As ever tempest beat ! 
Out of its head an Oak had grown, 
A Broom out of its feet. 
The time was March, a cheerful noon — 
The thaw-wind, with the breath of June, 
Breathed gently from the warm south-west : 
When, in a voice sedate with age, 
This Oak, a giant and a sage, 
His neighbour thus addressed : — 

' Eight weary weeks, through rock and clay, 
Along this mountain's edge, 
The Frost hath wrought both night and day, 
Wedge driving after wedge. 
Look up ! and think, above your head 
What trouble, surely, will be bred ; 
Last night I heard a crash — 'tis true, 
The splinters took another road — 
I see them yonder — what a load 
For such a Thing as you ! 

You are preparing as before, 
To deck your slender shape ; 
And yet, just three years back — no more — 
You had a strange escape : 
Down from yon cliff a fragment broke ; 
It thundered down, with fire and smoke, 
And hitherward pursued its way ; 
This ponderous block was caught by me, 
And o'er your head, as you may see, 
"Tis hanging to this day ! 

If breeze or bird to this rough steep 
Your kind's first seed did bear ; 
The breeze had better been asleep, 
The bird caught in a snare : 
For you and your green twigs decoy 
The little witless shepherd-boy 
To come and slumber in your bower ; 
And, trust me, on some sultry noon, 
Both you and he, Heaven knows how soon ! 
Will perish in one hour. 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

VI. 

Their nuptial song, a gladsome air ; 

From me this friendly warning take' — 

And to her own green bower the breeze 

The Broom began to doze, 

That instant brought two stripling bees 

And thus, to keep herself awake, 

To rest, or murmur there. 

Did gently interpose : 


'My thanks for your discourse are due ; 

XI. 

That more than what you say is true, 

One night, my Children ! from the north 

I know, and I have known it long ; 

There came a furious blast ; 

Frail is the bond by which we hold 

At break of day I ventured forth, 

Our being, whether young or old, 

And near the cliff I passed. 

Wise, foolish, weak, or strong. 

The storm had fallen upon the Oak, 


And struck him with a mighty stroke, 

VII. 

And whirled, and whirled him far away ; 

Disasters, do the best we can, 

And, in one hospitable cleft, 

Will reach both great and small ; 

The little careless Broom was left 

And he is oft the wisest man, 

To live for many a day." 

Who is not wise at all. 

. 

For me, why should I wish to roam  


This spot is my paternal home, 


It is my pleasant heritage ; 


My father many a happy year, 

VI. 

Spread here his careless blossoms, here 

TO A SEXTON. 

Attained a good old age. 



Let thy wheel-barrow alone — 

VIII. 

Wherefore, Sexton, piling still 

Even such as his may be my lot. 

In thy bone-house bone on bone ? 

What cause have I to haunt 

'Tis already like a hill 

My heart with terrors ? Am I not 

In a field of battle made, 

In truth a favoured plant ! 

Where three thousand skulls are laid; 

On me such bounty Summer pours, 

These died in peace each with the other,. — ■ 

That I am covered o'er with flowers ; 

Father, sister, friend, and brother. 

And, when the Frost is in the sky, 


My branches are so fresh and gay 

Mark the spot to which I point ! 

That you might look at me and say, 

From this platform, eight feet square, 

This Plant can never die. 

Take not even a finger-joint: 


Andrew's whole fire-side is there. 

IX. 

Here, alone, before thine eyes, 
Simon's sickly daughter lies, 

The butterfly, all green and gold, 

To me hath often flown, 


From weakness now, and pain defended, 

Here in my blossoms to behold 

Whom he twenty winters tended. 

Wings lovely as his own. 


When grass is chill with rain or dew, 


Beneath my shade, the mother-ewe 

Look but at the gardener's pride — 

Lies with her infant lamb ; I see 

How he glories, when he sees 

The love they to each other make, 

Roses, lilies, side by side, 

And the sweet joy which they partake, 

Violets in families ! 

It is a joy to me.' 

By the heart of Man, his tears, 


By his hopes and by his fears, 

X. 

Thou, too heedless, art the Warden 

Her voice was blithe, her heart was light ; 

Of a far superior garden. 

The Broom might have pursued 


Her speech, until the stars of night 

Thus then, each to other dear, 

Their journey had renewed ; 

Let them all in quiet lie, 

But in the branches of the oak 

Andrew there, and Susan here, 

Two ravens now began to croak 

Neighbours in mortality. 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

 

And, should I live through sun and rain 
Seven widowed years without my Jane, 
Sexton, do not then remove her, 
Let one grave hold the Loved and Lover ! 
. 

TO THE DAISY. 

' Her divine skill taught me this, 
That from every thing I saw 
I could some instruction draw, 
And raise pleasure to the height 
Through the meanest object's sight. 
By the murmur of a spring, 
Or the least bough's rustelling ; 
By a Daisy whose leaves spread 
Shut when Titan goes to bed ; 
Or a shady bush or tree ; 
She could more infuse in me 
Than all Nature's beauties can 
In some other wiser man.' 
G. Wither. 
In youth from rock to rock I went, 
From hill to hill in discontent 
Of pleasure high and turbulent, 
Most pleased when most uneasy ; 
But now my own delights I make, — 
My thirst at every rill can slake, 
And gladly Nature's love partake, 
Of Thee, sweet Daisy ! 
Thee Winter in the garland wears 
That thinly decks his few grey hairs ; 
Spring parts the clouds with softest airs, 
That she may sun thee ; 
Whole Summer-fields are thine by right ; 
And Autumn, melancholy Wight ! 
Doth in thy crimson head delight 
When rains are on thee. 
In shoals and bands, a morrice train, 
Thou greet'st the traveller in the lane ; 
Pleased at his greeting thee again ; 
Yet nothing daunted, 
Nor grieved if thou be set at nought : 
And oft alone in nooks remote 
We meet thee, like a pleasant thought, 
When such are wanted. 
Be violets in their secret mews 
The flowers the wanton Zephyrs choose ; 
Proud be the rose, with rains and dews 
Her head impearling, 
 His muse. 

Thou liv'st with less ambitious aim, 
Yet hast not gone without thy fame ; 
Thou art indeed by many a claim 
The Poet's darling. 
If to a rock from rains he fly, 
Or, some bright day of April sky, 
Imprisoned by hot sunshine He 
Near the green holly, 
And wearily at length should fare ; 
He needs but look about, and there 
Thou art !— a friend at hand, to scare 
His melancholy. 
A hundred times, by rock or bower, 
Ere thus I have lain couched an hour, 
Have I derived from thy sweet power 
Some apprehension ; 
Some steady love ; some brief delight ; 
Some memory that had taken flight ; 
Some chime of fancy wrong or right ; 
Or stray invention. 
If stately passions in me burn, 
And one chance look to Thee should turn, 
I drink out of an humbler urn 
A lowlier pleasure ; 
The homely sympathy that heeds 
The common life, our nature breeds ; 
A wisdom fitted to the needs 
Of hearts at leisure. 
Fresh-smitten by the morning ray, 
When thou art up, alert and gay, 
Then, cheerful Flower ! my spirits play 
With kindred gladness : 
And when, at dusk, by dews opprest 
Thou sink'st, the image of thy rest 
Hath often eased my pensive breast 
Of careful sadness. 
And all day long I number yet, 
All seasons through, another debt, 
Which I, wherever thou art met, 
To thee am owing; 
An instinct call it, a blind sense ; 
A happy, genial influence, 
Coming one knows not how, nor whence. 
Nor whither going. 
Child of the Year ! that round dost run 
Thy pleasant course, — when day's begun 
As ready to salute the sun 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

As lark or leveret. 
Thy long-lost praise thou shalt regain ; 
Nor be less dear to future men 
Than in old time ; — thou not in vain 
Art Nature's favourite. 

TO THE SAME FLOWER. 
With little here to do or see 
Of things that in the great world be, 
Daisy ! again I talk to thee, 
For thou art worthy, 
Thou unassuming Common-place 
Of Nature, with that homely face, 
And yet with something of a grace, 
Which Love makes for thee ! 
Oft on the dappled turf at ease 
I sit, and play with similies, 
Loose types of things through all degrees, 
Thoughts of thy raising : 
And many a fond and idle name 
I give to thee, for praise or blame, 
As is the humour of the game, 
While I am gazing. 
A nun demure of lowly port; 
Or sprightly maiden, of Love's court, 
In thy simplicity the sport 
Of all temptations ; 
A queen in crown of rubies drest ; 
A starveling in a scanty vest ; 
Are all, as seems to suit thee best, 
Thy appellations. 
A little cyclops, with one eye 
Staring to threaten and defy, 
That thought comes next — and instantly 
The fj-eak is over, 
The shape will vanish — and behold 
A silver shield with boss of gold, 
That spreads itself, some faery bold 
In fight to cover ! 
I see thee glittering from afar — 
And then thou art a pretty star ; 
Not quite so fan' as many are 

 See, in Chaucer and the elder Poets, the honours 
formerly paid to this flower. 

In heaven above thee ! 
Yet like a star, with glittering crest, 
Self-poised in ah' thou seem'st to rest ; — - 
May peace come never to his nest, 
Who shall reprove thee ! 
Bright Floiver ! for by that name at last, 
When all my reveries are past, 
I call thee, and to that cleave fast, 
Sweet silent creature ! 
That breath'st with me in sun and air, 
Do thou, as thou art wont, repair 
My heart with gladness, and a share 
Of thy meek nature ! 

THE GREEN LINNET. 
Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed 
Their snow-white blossoms on my head, 
With brightest sunshine round me spread 
Of spring's unclouded weather, 
In this sequestered nook how sweet 
To sit upon my orchard-seat ! 
And birds and flowers once more to greet, 
My last year's friends together. 
One have I marked, the happiest guest 
In all this covert of the blest : 
Hail to Thee, far above the rest 
In joy of voice and pinion ! 
Thou, Linnet ! in thy green array, 
Presiding Spirit here to-day, 
Dost lead the revels of the May ; 
And this is thy dominion. 
While birds, and butterflies, and flowers, 
Make all one band of paramours, 
Thou, ranging up and down the bowers, 
Art sole in thy employment : 
A Life, a Presence like the Air, 
Scattering thy gladness without care, 
Too blest with any one to pair ; 
Thyself thy own enjoyment. 
Amid yon tuft of hazel trees, 
That twinkle to the gusty breeze, 
Behold him perched in ecstacies, 
Yet seeming still to hover ; 
There ! where the flutter of his wings 
Upon his back and body flings 
Shadows and sunny glimmerings, 
That cover him all over. 




POEMS OF ' 

rHE FANCY. 

 

My dazzled sight he oft deceives. 



A Brother of the dancing leaves ; 

XI. 


Then flits, and from the cottage-eaves 

TO THE SMALL CELANDINE. 


Pours forth his song in gushes ; 



As if by that exulting strain 
He mocked and treated with disdain 

Pansies, lilies, kingcups, daisies, 


Let them live upon their praises ; 


The voiceless Form he chose to feign, 

Long as there's a sun that sets, 


While fluttering in the bushes. 

Primroses will have their glory ; 


JW. 

Long as there are violets, 
They will have a place in story : 
There 's a flower that shall be mine, 



X. 

'Tis the little Celandine. 


Eyes of some men travel far 


TO A SKY-LARK. 

For the finding of a star ; 


Up with me ! up with me into the clouds .' 

Up and down the heavens they go, 


For thy song, Lark, is strong; 

Men that keep a mighty rout ! 


Up with me, up with me into the clouds ! 

I 'm as great as they, I trow, 


Singing, singing, 

Since the day I found thee out, 


With clouds and sky about thee ringing, 

Little Flower ! — I ' make a stir, 


Lift me, guide me till I find 

Like a sage astronomer. 


That spot which seems so to thy mind ! 

Modest, yet withal an Elf 
Bold, and lavish of thyself ; 


I have walked through wildernesses dreary 

Since we needs must first have met 


And to-day my heart is weary ; 

I have seen thee, high and low, 


Had I now the wings of a Faery, 

Thirty years or more, and yet 


Up to thee would I fly. 

'Twas a face I did not know ; 


There is madness about thee, and joy divine 

Thou hast now, go where I may, 


In that song of thine ; 

Fifty greetings in a day. 


Lift me, guide me high and high 



To thy banqueting-place in the sky. 

Ere a leaf is on a bush, 
In the time before the thrush 


Joyous as morning, 

Has a thought about her nest, 


Thou art laughing and scorning ; 

Thou wilt come with half a call, 


Thou hast a nest for thy love and thy rest, 

Spreading out thy glossy breast 


And, though little troubled with sloth, 

Like a careless Prodigal ; 


Drunken Lark ! thou would'st be loth 

Telling tales about the sun, 


To be such a traveller as I. 

When we 've little warmth, or none. 


Happy, happy Liver, 



With a soul as strong as a mountain river 

Poets, vain men in their mood ! 


Pouring out praise to the almighty Giver, 

Travel with the multitude : 


Joy and jollity be with us both ! 

Never heed them ; I aver 
That they all are wanton wooers ; 
But the thrifty cottager, 


Alao ! my journey, rugged and uneven, 

Who stirs little out of doors, 


Through prickly moors or dusty ways must wind ; 

Joys to spy thee near her home ; 


But healing thee, or others of thy kind, 

Spring is coming, Thou art come ! 


As full of gladness and as free of heaven, 


I, with my fate contented, will plod on, 

Comfort have thou of thy merit, 
Kindly, unassuming Spirit ! 


And hope for higher raptures, when life's day is done. 
. 


Careless of thy neighbourhood, 



Thou dost show thy pleasant face 




 Common Pilewort. 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

On the moor, and in the wood, 

Often have I sighed to measure 


In the lane ; — there 's not a place, 

By myself a lonely pleasure, 


Howsoever mean it be, 

Sighed to think, I read a book 


But 'tis good enough for thee. 

Only read, perhaps, by me ; 
Yet I long could overlook 


Ill befal the yellow flowers, 

Thy bright coronet and Thee, 


Children of the flaring hours ! 

And thy arch and wily ways, 


Buttercups, that will be seen, 

And thy store of other praise. 


Whether we will see or no ; 



Others, too, of lofty mien ; 

Blithe of heart, from week to week 


They have done as worldlings do, 

Thou dost play at hide-and-seek ; 


Taken praise that should be thine, 

While the patient primrose sits 


Little, humble Celandine ! 

Like a beggar in the cold, 
Thou, a flower of wiser wits, 


Prophet of delight and mirth, 

Slip'st into thy sheltering hold ; 


Ill-requited upon earth ; 

Liveliest of the vernal train 


Herald of a mighty band, 

When ye all are out again. 


Of a joyous train ensuing, 



Serving at my heart's command, 

Drawn by what peculiar spell, 


Tasks that are no tasks renewing, 

By what charm of sight or smell, 


I will sing, as doth behove, 

Does the dim-eyed curious Bee, 


Hymns in praise of what I love ! 

Labouring for her waxen cells, 


J. 

Fondly settle upon Thee 
Prized above all buds and bells 





Opening daily at thy side, 


XII. 

By the season multiplied? 


TO THE SAME FLOWER. 

Thou art not beyond the moon, 


Pleasures newly found are sweet 

But a thing ' beneath our shoon : ' 


When they lie about our feet : 

Let the bold Discoverer thrid 


February last, my heart 

In his bark the polar sea ; 


First at sight of thee was glad ; 

Rear who will a pyramid ; 


All unheard of as thou art, 

Praise it is enough for me, 


Thou must needs, I think, have had, 

If there be but three or four 


Celandine ! and long ago, 

Who will love my little Flower. 


Praise of which I nothing know. 

 


I have not a doubt but he, 

xnr. 


Whosoe'er the man might be, 

THE SEVEN SISTERS ; 


Who the first with pointed rays 



(Workman worthy to be sainted) 

OR, 


Set the sign-board in a blaze, 

THE SOLITUDE OF BINNORIE. 


When the rising sun he painted, 

i. 


Took the fancy from a glance 

Seven Daughters had Lord Archibald, 


At thy glittering countenance. 

All children of one mother : 
You could not say in one short day 


Soon as gentle breezes bring 

What love they bore each other. 


News of winter's vanishing, 

A garland, of seven lilies, wrought ! 


And the children build their bowers, 

Seven Sisters that together dwell ; 


Sticking 'kerchief-plots of mould 

But he, bold Knight as ever fought, 


All about with full-blown flowers, 

Their Father, took of them no thought, 


Thick as sheep in shepherd's fold ! 

He loved the wars so well. 


With the proudest thou art there, 

Sing, mournfully, oh ! mournfully, 


Mantling in the tiny square. 

The solitude of Binnorie ! 


POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

 

Fresh blows the wind, a western wind, 
And from the shores of Erin, 
Across the wave, a Rover brave 
To Binnorie is steering : 
Right onward to the Scottish strand 
The gallant ship is bome ; 
The warriors leap upon the land, 
And hark ! the Leader of the band 
Hath blown his bugle horn. 
Sing, mournfully, oh ! mournfully, 
The solitude of Binnorie. 

Beside a grotto of their own, 
With boughs above them closing, 
The Seven are laid, and in the shade 
They lie like fawns reposing. 
But now, upstarting with affright 
At noise of man and steed, 
Away they fly to left, to right — 
Of your fair household, Father-knight, 
Methinks you take small heed ! 
Sing, mournfully, oh ! mournfully, 
The solitude of Binnorie. 

Away the seven fair Campbells fly, 
And, over hill and hollow, 
With menace proud, and insult loud, 
The youthful Rovers follow. 
Cried they, " Your Father loves to roam 
Enough for him to find 
The empty house when he comes home ; 
For us your yellow ringlets comb, 
For us be fair and kind ! " 
Sing, mournfully, oh ! mournfully, 
The solitude of Binnorie. 

Some close behind, some side by side, 
Like clouds in stormy weather ; 
They run, and cry, " Nay, let us die, 
And let us die together." 
A lake was near ; the shore was steep 
There never foot had been ; 
They ran, and with a desperate leap 
Together plunged into the deep, 
Nor ever more were seen. 
Sing, mournfully, oh ! mournfully, 
The solitude of Binnorie. 

The stream that flows out of the lake, 
As through the glen it rambles, 
Repeats a moan o'er moss and stone, 
For those seven lovely Campbells. 
Seven little Islands, green and bare • 
Have risen from out the deep : 
The fishers say, those sisters fair, 
By faeries all are buried there, 
And there together sleep. 
Sing, mournfully, oh ! mournfully, 
The solitude of Binnorie. 

Who fancied what a pretty sight 
This Rock would be if edged around 
With living snow-drops ? circlet bright ! 
How glorious to this orchard-ground ! 
Who loved the little Rock, and set 
Upon its head this coronet ? 
Was it the humour of a child \ 
Or rather of some gentle maid, 
Whose brows, the day that she was styled 
The shepherd-queen, were thus arrayed ? 
Of man mature, or matron sage ? 
Or old man toying with his age ! 
I asked — 'twas whispered ; The device 
To each and all might well belong : 
Tt is the Spirit of Paradise 
That prompts such work, a Spirit strong, 
That gives to all the self-same bent 
Where life is wise and innocent. 

REDBREAST CHASING THE BUTTERFLY. 
Art thou the bird whom Man loves best, 
The pious bird with the scarlet breast, 
Our little English Robin ; 
The bird that comes about our doors 
When Autumn-winds are sobbing ? 
Art thou the Peter of Norway Boors ? 
Their Thomas in Finland, 
And Russia far inland \ 
The bird, that by some name or other 
All men who know thee call then" brother, 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

The darling of children and men ? 
Could Father Adam open his eyes 
And see this sight beneath the skies, 
He 'd wish to close them again. 
— If the Butterfly knew but his friend. 
Hither Ms flight he woidd bend ; 
And find his way to me, 
Under the branches of the tree : 
In and out, he darts about ; 
Can this be the bird, to man so good, 
That, after their bewildering, 
Covered with leaves the little children, 
So painfully in the wood ? 
What ailed thee, Robin, that thou could'st pursue 
A beautiful creature, 
That is gentle by nature ? 
Beneath the summer sky 
From flower to flower let him fly ; 
'Tis all that he wishes to do. 
The cheerer Thou of our in-door sadness, 
He is the friend of our summer gladness : 
What hinders, then, that ye should be 
Playmates in the sunny weather, 
And fly about in the air together ! 
His beautiful wings in crimson are drest, 
A crimson as bright as thine own : 
Would'st thou be happy in thy nest, 
O pious Bird ! whom man loves best, 
Love him, or leave him alone ! 
. 

SONG FOR THE SPINNING WHEEL. 
FOUNDED UPON A BELIEF PREVALENT AMONG THE PASTORAX, 
VALES OF WESTMORELAND. 
Swiftly turn the murmuring wheel ! 
Night has brought the welcome hour, 
When the weary fingers feel 
Help, as if from faery power ; 
Dewy night o'ershades the ground ; 
Turn the swift wheel round and round ! 
Now, beneath the starry sky, 
Couch the widely-scattered sheep ; — 
Ply the pleasant labour, ply ! 
For the spindle, while they sleep, 
Runs with speed more smooth and fine, 
Gathering up a trustier line. 

 See Paradise Lost, Book XI., where Adam points out 
to Eve the ominous sign of the Eagle chasing < two Birds 
of gayest plume,' and the gentle Hart and Hind pursued 
by their enemy. 

Short-lived likings may be bred 
By a glance from fickle eyes ; 
But true love is like the thread 
Which the kindly wool supplies, 
When the flocks are all at rest 
Sleeping on the mountain's breast. 

XVII, 
HINT FROM THE MOUNTAINS 
FOR CERTAIN POLITICAL PRETENDERS. 
" Who but hails the sight with pleasure 
When the wings of genius rise, 
Their ability to measure 
With great enterprise ; 
But in man was ne'er such daring 
As yon Hawk exhibits, pairing 
His brave spirit with the war in 
The stormy skies ! 
Mark him, how his power he uses, 
Lays it by, at will resumes ! 
Mark, ere for his haunt he chooses 
Clouds and utter glooms ! 
There, he wheels in downward mazes ; 
Sunward now his flight he raises, 
Catches fire, as seems, and blazes 
With uninjured plumes !" — 
ANSWER. 
" Stranger, 'tis no act of courage 
Which aloft thou dost discern ; 
No bold bird gone forth to forage 
'Mid the tempest stern ; 
But such mockery as the nations 
See, when public perturbations 
Lift men from their native stations, 
Like yon Tuft of fern ; 
Such it is ; the aspiring creature 
Soaring on undaunted wing, 
(So you fancied) is by nature 
A dull helpless thing, 
Dry and withered, light and yellow ; — 
That to be the tempest's fellow ! 
Wait — and you shall see how hollow 
Its endeavouring !"

ON SEEING A NEEDLECASE IN THE 
FORM OF A HARP. 
THE WORK OF K.M.S. 
Frowns are on every MuseVface, 
Reproaches from their lips are sent, 
That mimicry should thus disgrace 
The noble Instrument. 
A very Harp in all but size ! 
Needles for strings in apt gradation ! 
Minerva's self would stigmatize 
The unclassic profanation. 
Even her own needle that subdued 
Arachne's rival spirit, 
Though wrought in Vulcan's happiest mood, 
Such honour could not merit. 
And this, too, from the Laureate's Child, 
A living lord of melody ! 
How will her Sire be reconciled 
To the refined indignity \ 
I spake, when whispered a low voice, 
" Bard ! moderate your ire ; 
Spirits of all degrees rejoice 
In presence of the lyre. 
The Minstrels of Pygmean bands, 
Dwarf Genii, moonlight-loving Fays, 
Have shells to fit their tiny hands 
And suit their slender lays. 
Some, still more delicate of ear, 
Have lutes (believe my words) 
Whose framework is of gossamer, 
While sunbeams are the chords. 
Gay Sylphs this miniature will court, 
Made vocal by then- brushing wings, 
And sullen Gnomes will learn to sport 
Around its polished strings ; 
Whence strains to love-sick maiden dear, 
While in her lonely bower she tries 
To cheat the thought she cannot cheer, 
By fanciful embroideries. 
Trust, angry Bard ! a knowing Sprite, 
Nor think, the Harp her lot deplores ; 
Though 'mid the stars the Lyre shine bright, 
Love stoops as fondly as he soars." 
. 

TO A LADY, 
IN ANSWER TO A REQUEST THAT I WOULD WRITE HER A 
POEM UPON SOME DRAWINGS THAT SHE HAD MADE OF 
FLOWERS IN THE ISLAND OF MADEIRA. 
Faie Lady ! can I sing of flowers 
That in Madeira bloom and fade, 
I who ne'er sate -within their bowers, 
Nor through their sunny lawns have strayed \ 
How they in sprightly dance are worn 
By Shepherd-groom or May-day queen, 
Or holy festal pomps adorn, 
These eyes have never seen. 
Yet tho' to me the pencil's art 
No like remembrances can give, 
Your portraits still may reach the heart 
And there for gentle pleasure live ; 
While Fancy ranging with free scope 
Shall on some lovely Alien set 
A name with us endeared to hope, 
To peace, or fond regret. 
Still as we look with nicer care, 
Some new resemblance we may trace : 
A Hearth-ease will perhaps be there, 
A Speedwell may not want its place. 
And so may we, with charmed mind 
Beholding what your skill has wrought, 
Another Star-of-Betldeliem find, 
A new Forget-me-not. 
From earth to heaven with motion fleet 
From heaven to earth our thoughts will pass, 
A Holy-thistle here we meet 
And there a Shepherd's weather-glass; 
And haply some familiar name 
Shall grace the fairest, sweetest, plant 
Whose presence cheers the drooping frame 
Of English Emigrant. 
Gazing she feels its power beguile 
Sad thoughts, and breathes with easier breath ; 
Alas ! that meek that tender smile 
Is but a harbinger of death : 
And pointing with a feeble hand 
She says, in faint words by sighs broken, 
Bear for me to my native land 
This precious Flower, true love's last token. 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

Glad sight wherever new with old 
Is joined through some dear homehorn tie ; 
The life of all that we behold 
Depends upon that mystery. 
Vain is the glory of the sky, 
The beauty vain of field and grove 
Unless, while with admiring eye 
We gaze, we also learn to love. 

THE CONTRAST. 
THE PARROT AND THE WREN. 
I. 
Within her gilded cage confined, 
I saw a dazzling Belle, 
A Parrot of that famous kind 
Whose name is Non-pareil. 
Like beads of glossy jet her eyes ; 
And, smoothed by Nature's skill, 
With pearl or gleaming agate vies 
Her finely-curved bill. 
Her plumy mantle's living hues 
In mass opposed to mass, 
Outshine the splendour that imbues 
The robes of pictured glass. 
And, sooth to say, an apter Mate 
Did never tempt the choice 
Of feathered Thing most delicate 
In figure and in voice. 
But, exiled from Australian bowers, 
And singleness her lot, 
She trills her song with tutored powers, 
Or mocks each casual note. 
No more of pity for regrets 
With which she may have striven ! 
Now but in wantonness she frets, 
Or spite, if cause be given ; 
Arch, volatile, a sportive bird 
By social glee inspired ; 
Ambitious to be seen or heard, 
And pleased to be admired ! 

This moss-lined shed, green, soft, and dry, 
Harbours a self-contented Wren, 
Not shunning man's abode, though shy, 
Almost as thought itself, of human ken. 
Strange places, coverts unendeared, 
She never tried ; the very nest 
In which this Child of Spring was reared, 
Is warmed, thro' winter, by her feathery breast. 
To the bleak winds she sometimes gives 
A slender unexpected strain ; 
Proof that the hermitess still lives, 
Though she appear not, and be sought in vain. 
Say, Dora ! tell me, by yon placid moon, 
If called to choose between the favoured pair, 
Which would you be, — the bird of the saloon, 
By lady-fingers tended with nice care, 
Caressed, applauded, upon dainties fed, 
Or Nature's Darkling of this mossy shed  
. 

THE DANISH BOY. 

A FRAGMENT. 

Between two sister moorland rills 
There is a spot that seems to lie 
Sacred to flowerets of the hills, 
And sacred to the sky. 
And in this smooth and open dell 
There is a tempest-stricken tree ; 
A corner-stone by lightning cut, 
The last stone of a lonely hut ; 
And in this dell you see 
A thing no storm can e'er destroy, 
The shadow of a Danish Boy. 

In clouds above, the lark is heard, 
But drops not here to earth for rest ; 
Within this lonesome nook the bird 
Did never build her nest. 
No beast, no bird hath here his home ; 
Bees, wafted on the breezy air, 
Pass high above those fragrant bells 
To other flowers : — to other dells 
Their burthens do they bear ; 
The Danish Boy walks here alone : 
The lovely dell is all his own. 


POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

 

A Spirit of noon-day is he ; 
Yet seems a form of flesh and blood; 
Nor piping shepherd shall he be, 
Nor herd-boy of the wood. 
A regal vest of fur he wears, 
In colour like a raven's wing; 
It fears not rain, nor wind, nor dew ; 
But in the storm tis fresh and blue 
As budding pines in spring ; 
His helmet has a vernal grace, 
Fresh as the bloom upon his face. 

A harp is from his shoulder slung ; 
Resting the harp upon his knee ; 
To words of a forgotten tongue, 
He suits its melody. 
Of flocks upon the neighbouring hill 
He is the darling and the joy ; 
And often, when no cause appears, 
The mountain-ponies prick their ears, 
— They hear the Danish Boy, 
While in the dell he sings alone 
Beside the tree and corner-stone. 

There sits he ; in his face you spy 
No trace of a ferocious air, 
Nor ever was a cloudless sky 
So steady or so fair. 
The lovely Danish Boy is blest 
And happy in his flowery cove : 
From bloody deeds his thoughts are far; 
And yet he warbles songs of war, 
That seem like songs of love, 
For calm and gentle is his mien ; 
Like a dead Boy he is serene. 

XXIII. 
SONG 
FOR THE WANDERING JEW. 
Though the torrents from their fountains 
Roar down many a craggy steep, 
Yet they find among the mountains 
Resting-places calm and deep. 
Clouds that love through air to hasten, 
Ere the storm its fury stills, 
Helmet-like thdmselves will fasten 
On the heads of towering hills. 

What, if through the frozen centre 
Of the Alps the Chamois bound, 
Yet he has a home to enter 
In some nook of chosen ground : 
And the Sea-horse, though the ocean 
Yield him no domestic cave, 
Slumbers without sense of motion, 
Couched upon the rocking wave. 
If on windy days the Raven 
Gambol like a dancing skiff, 
Not the less she loves her haven 
In the bosom of the cliff. 
The fleet Ostrich, till day closes, 
Vagrant over desert sands, 
Brooding on her eggs reposes 
When chill night that care demands. 
Day and night my toils redouble, 
Never nearer to the goal ; 
Night and day, I feel the trouble 
Of the Wanderer in my soul. 

XXIV. 
STRAY PLEASURES. 
■ Pleasure is spread through the earth 
In stray gifts to he claimed, by whoever shall find.' 
By their floating mill, 
That lies dead and still, 
Behold yon Prisoners three, 
The Miller with two Dames, on the breast of the 
Thames ! 
The platform is small, but gives room for them all ; 
And they 're dancing merrily. 
From the shore come the notes 
To their mill where it floats, 
To their house and their mill tethered fast : 
To the small wooden isle where, their work to 
beguile, 
They from morning to even take whatever is given ; — 
And many a blithe day they have past. 
In sight of the spires, 
All alive with the fires 
Of the sun going down to his rest, 
In the broad open eye of the solitary sky, 
They dance, — there are three, as jocund as free, 
While they dance on the calm river's breast. 

G 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

Man and Maidens wheel, 
They themselves make the reel, 
And their music 's a prey which they seize ; 
It plays not for them, — what matter ? 'tis theirs ; 
And if they had care, it has scattered their cares, 
While they dance, crying, "Long as ye please ! " 
They dance not for me, 
Yet mine is their glee ! 
Thus pleasure is spread through the earth 
In sti'ay gifts to be claimed by whoever shall find ; 
Thus a rich loving-kindness, redundantly kind, 
Moves all nature to gladness and mirth. 
The showers of the spring 
Rouse the birds, and they sing ; 
If the wind do but stir for his proper delight, 
Each leaf, that and this, his neighbour will kiss ; 
Each wave, one and t' other, speeds after his brother : 
They are happy, for that is their right ! 
. 

THE PILGRIM'S DREAM; 
OR, THR STAR AND THE GLOW-WORM. 
A Pilgrim, when the summer day 
Had closed upon his weary way, 
A lodging begged beneath a castle's roof ; 
But him the haughty Warder spurned ; 
And from the gate the Pilgrim turned, 
To seek such covert as the field 
Or heath-besprinkled copse might yield, 
Or lofty wood, shower-proof. 
He paced along ; and, pensively, 
Halting beneath a shady tree, 
Whose moss-grown root might serve for couch or 
seat, 
Fixed on a Star his upward eye ; 
Then, from the tenant of the sky 
He turned, and watched with kindred look, 
A Glow-worm, in a dusky nook, 
Apparent at his feet.' 
The murmur of a neighbouring stream 
Induced a soft and slumbrous dream, 
A pregnant dream, within whose shadowy bounds 
He recognised the earth-born Star, 
And Tliat which glittered from afar ; 
And (strange to witness !) from the frame 
Of the ethereal Orb, there came 
Intelligible sounds. 

Much did it taunt the humble Light 
That now, when day was fled, and night 
Hushed the dark earth, fast closing weary eyes, 
A very reptile could presume 
To show her taper in the gloom, 
As if in rivalship with One 
Who sate a ruler on his throne 
Erected in the skies. 
" Exalted Star !" the Worm replied, 
" Abate this unbecoming pride, 
Or with a less uneasy lustre shine ; 
Thou shrink'st as momently thy rays 
Are mastered by the breathing haze ; 
While neither mist, nor thickest cloud 
That shapes in heaven its murky shroud, 
Hath power to injure mine. 
But not for this do I aspire 
To match the spark of local fire, 
That at my will burns on the dewy lawn, 
With thy acknowledged glories ; — No ! 
Yet, thus upbraided, I may show 
What favours do attend me here, 
Till, like thyself, I disappear 
Before the purple dawn." 
When this in modest guise was said, 
Across the welkin seemed to spread 
A boding sound — for aught but sleep unfit ! 
Hills quaked, the rivers backward ran ; 
That Star, so proud  late, looked wan ; 
And reeled with visionary stir 
In the blue depth, like Lucifer 
Cast headlong to the pit ! 
Fire raged : and, when the spangled floor 
Of ancient ether was no more, 
New heavens succeeded, by the dream brought fort 
And all the happy Souls that rode 
Transfigured through that fresh abode, 
Had heretofore, in humble trust, 
Shone meekly mid their native dust, 
The Glow-worms of the earth ! 
This knowledge, from an Angel's voice 
Proceeding, made the heart rejoice 
Of Him who slept upon the open lea : 
Waking at morn he murmured not ; 
And, till life's journey closed, the spot 
Was to the Pilgrim's soul endeared, 
Where by that dream he had been cheered 
Beneath the shady tree.

POET AND THE CAGED TURTLEDOVE. 


As often as I murmur here 

There to the brooding bird her mate 

My half-formed melodies, 

Warbles by fits his low clear song ; 

Straight from her osier mansion near, 

And by the busy streamlet both 

The Turtledove replies : 

Are sung to all day long. 

Though silent as a leaf before, 


The captive promptly coos ; 

Or in sequestered lanes they build, 

Is it to teach her own soft lore, 

Where, till the flitting bird's return, 

Or second my weak Muse ? 

Her eggs within the nest repose, 


Like relics in an urn. 

I rather think, the gentle Dove 


Is murmuring a reproof, 

But still, where general choice is good, 

Displeased that I from lays of love 

There is a better and a best ; 

Have dared to keep aloof; 

And, among fairest objects, some 

That I, a Bard of hill and dale, 

Are fairer than the rest ; 

Have caroll'd, fancy free, 


As if nor dove nor nightingale, 

This, one of those small builders proved 

Had heart or voice for me. 

In a green covert, where, from out 


The forehead of a pollard oak, 

If such thy meaning, forbear, 
Sweet Bird ! to do me wrong ; 


The leafy antlers sprout ; 

Love, blessed Love, is every where 
The spirit of my song : 
'Mid grove, and by the calm fireside, 


For She who planned the mossy lodge, 
Mistrusting her evasive skill, 


Had to a Primrose looked for aid 

Love animates my lyre — 


Her wishes to fulfil. 

That coo again ! — 't is not to chide, 


I feel, but to inspire. 


. 

High on the trunk's projecting brow, 


And fixed an infant's span above 
The budding flowers, peeped forth the nest 


XXVII. 

The prettiest of the grove ! 

A WREN'S NEST. 

The treasure proudly did I show 

Among the dwellings framed by birds 

To some whose minds without disdain 

In field or forest with nice care, 

Can turn to little things ; but once 

Is none that with the little Wren's 

Looked up for it in vain : 

In snugness may compare. 



'Tis gone — a ruthless spoiler's prey, 

No door the tenement requires, 

Who heeds not beauty, love, or song, 

And seldom needs a laboured roof ; 

'Tis gone ! (so seemed it) and we grieved 

Yet is it to the fiercest sun 

Indignant at the wrong. 

Impervious, and storm-proof. 


So warm, so beautiful withal, 
In perfect fitness for its aim, 

Just three days after, passing by 
In clearer light the moss-built cell 

I saw, espied its shaded mouth ; 
And felt that all was well. 

That to the Kind by special grace 

Their instinct surely came. 


And when for their abodes they seek 

The Primrose for a veil had spread 

An opportune recess, 

The largest of her upright leaves ; 

The hermit has no finer eye 

And thus, for purposes benign, 

For shadowy quietness. 

A simple flower deceives. 



 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

Concealed from friends who might disturb 
Thy quiet with no ill intent, 
Secure from evil eyes and hands 
Ou barbarous plunder bent, 
Rest, Mother-bird ! and when thy young 
Take flight, and thou art free to roam, 
When withered is the guardian Flower, 
And empty thy late home, 
Think how ye prospered, thou and thine, 
Amid the unviolated grove 
Housed near the growing Primrose-tuft 
In foresight, or in love. 

LOVE LIES BLEEDING. 
You call it, " Love lies bleeding," — so you may, 
Though the ied Flower, not prostrate, only droops, 
As we have seen it here from day to day, 
From month to month, life passing not away : 
A flower how rich in sadness ! Even thus stoops, 
(Sentient by Grecian sculpture's marvellous power) 
Thus leans, with hanging brow and body bent 
Earthward in uncomplaining languishment, 
The dying Gladiator. So, sad Flower ! 
('Tis Fancy guides me willing to be led, 
Though by a slender thread,) 
So drooped Adonis bathed hi sanguine dew 
Of his death-wound, when he from innocent air 
The gentlest breath of resignation drew ; 
While Venus in a passion of despair 
Rent, weeping over him, her golden hah 
Spangled with drops of that celestial shower. 
She suffered, as Immortals sometimes do ; 
But pangs more lasting far, that Lover knew 
Who first, weighed down by scorn, in some lone 
bower 
Did press this semblance of unpitied smart 
Into the service of his constant heart, 
His own dejection, downcast Flower ! could share 
With thine, and gave the mournful name which 
thou wilt ever bear. 

XXIX. 
COMPANION TO THE FOREGOING. 
Never enlivened with the liveliest ray 
That fosters growth or checks or cheers decay, 
Nor by the heaviest rain-drops more deprest, 
This Flower, that first appeared as summer's guest, 

Preserves her beauty mid autumnal leaves 
And to her mournful habits fondly cleaves. 
When files of stateliest plants have ceased to bloor 
One after one submitting to their doom, 
When her coevals each and all are fled, 
What keeps her thus reclined upon her loneson 
bed? 
The old mythologists, more impress'd than we 
Of this late day by character in tree 
Or herb, that claimed peculiar sympathy, 
Or by the silent lapse of fountain clear, 
Or with the language of the viewless air 
By bird or beast made vocal, sought a cause 
To solve the mystery, not in Nature's laws 
But in Man's fortunes. Hence a thousand tales 
Sung to the plaintive lyre in Grecian vales. 
Nor doubt that something of their spirit swayed 
The fancy-stricken Youth or heart-sick Maid, 
Who, while each stood companionless and eyed 
This undeparting Flower in crimson dyed, 
Thought of a wound which death is slow to cure, 
A fate that has endured and will endure, 
And, patience coveting yet passion feeding, 
Called the dejected Lingerer, Love lies bleeding. 

RURAL ILLUSIONS. 

Sylph was it ? or a Bird more bright 
Than those of fabulous stock ? 
A second darted by ; — and lo ! 
Another of the flock, 
Through sunshine flitting from the bough 
To nestle in the rock. 
Transient deception ! a gay freak 
Of April's mimicries ! 
Those brilliant strangers, hailed with joy 
Among the budding trees, 
Proved last year's leaves, pushed from the spray 
To frolic on the breeze. 

Maternal Flora ! show thy face, 
And let thy hand be seen, 
Thy hand here sprinkling tiny flowers, 
That, as they touch the green, 
Take root (so seems it) and look up 
In honour of their Queen. 
Yet, sooth, those little starry specks, 
That not in vain aspired 


POEJMS OF THE FANCY.  

To be confounded with live growths, 

Now she works with three or four, 

Most dainty, most admired, 

Like an Indian conjurer ; 

Were only blossoms dropped from twigs 

Quick as he in feats of art, 

Of their own offspring tired. 

Far beyond in joy of heart. 


Were her antics played in the eye 

Not such the World's illusive shows ; 

Of a thousand standers-by, 

Her wingless flutterings, 

Clapping hands with shout and stare, 

Her blossoms which, though shed, outbrave 

What would little Tabby care 

The floweret as it springs, 

For the plaudits of the crowd ? 

For the undeceived, smile as they may, 

Over happy to be proud, 

Are melancholy things : 

Over wealthy in the treasure 

But gentle Nature plays her part 

Of her own exceeding pleasure ! 

With ever-varying wiles, 
And transient feignings with plain truth 

'Tis a pretty baby-treat ; 
Nor, I deem, for me unmeet ; 

So well she reconciles, 



Here, for neither Babe nor me, 

That those fond Idlers most are pleased 

Other play-mate can I see. 
Of the countless living things, 

Whom oftenest she beguiles.

Upon bough or grassy blade)

And this vale so blithe a place ; 

THE KITTEN AND FALLING LEAVES. 


Multitudes are swept away 

That way look, my Infant, lo ! 

Never more to breathe the day : 

What a pretty baby-show ! 

Some are sleeping ; some in bands 

See the Kitten on the wall, 

Travelled into distant lands ; 

Sporting with the leaves that fall, 

Others slunk to moor and wood, 

Withered leaves — one — two — and three — 

Far from human neighbourhood ; 

From the lofty elder-tree ! 

And, among the Kinds that keep 

Through the calm and frosty ah' 

With us closer fellowship, 

Of this morning bright and fair, 

With us openly abide, 

Eddying round and round they sink 

All have laid their mirth aside. 

Softly, slowly: one might think, 


From the motions that are made, 

Where is he that giddy Sprite, 

Every little leaf conveyed 

Blue-cap, with his colours bright, 

Sylph or Faery hither tending, — 

Who was blest as bird could be, 

To this lower world descending, 

Feeding in the apple-tree ; 

Each invisible and mute, 

Made such wanton spoil and rout, 

In his wavering parachute. 

Turning blossoms inside out ; 

But the Kitten, how she starts, 

Hung — head pointing towards the ground — 

Crouches, stretches, paws, and darts ! 

Fluttered, perched, into a round 

First at one, and then its fellow 

Bound himself, and then unbound ; 

Just as light and just as yellow ; 

Lithest, gaudiest Harlecpiin ! 

There are many now — now one — 

Prettiest Tumbler ever seen ! 

Now they stop and there are none : 

Light of heart and light of limb ; 

What intenseness of desire 

What is now become of Him ? 

In her upward eye of fire ! 

Lambs, that through the mountains went 

With a tiger-leap half way 

Frisking, bleating merriment, 

Now she meets the coming prey, 

When the year was in its prime, 

Lets it go as fast, and then 

They are sobered by this time. 

Has it in her power again : 

If you look to vale or hill, 
 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

If you listen, all is still, 
Save a little neighbouring rill, 
That from out the rocky ground 
Strikes a solitary sound. 
Vainly glitter hill and plain. 
And the air is calm in vain ; 
Vainly Morning spreads the lure 
Of a sky serene and pure ; 
Creature none can she decoy 
Into open sign of joy : 
Is it that they have a fear 
Of the dreary season near % 
Or that other pleasures be 
Sweeter even than gaiety ? 
Yet, whate'er enjoyments dwell 
In the impenetrable cell 
Of the silent heart which Nature 
Furnishes to every creature ; 
Whatsoe'er we feel and know 
Too sedate for outward show, 
Such a light of gladness breaks, 
Pretty Kitten! from thy freaks,— 
Spreads with such a living grace 
O'er my little Laura's face ; 
Yes, the sight so stirs and charms 
Thee, Baby, laughing in my arms, 
That almost I could repine 
That your transports are not mine, 
That I do not wholly fare 
Even as ye do, thoughtless pair ! 
And I will have my careless season 
Spite of melancholy reason, 
Will walk through life in such a way 
That, when time brings on decay, 
Now and then I may possess 
Hours of perfect gladsomeness. 
— Pleased by any random toy ; 
By a kitten's busy joy, 
Or an infant's laughing eye 
Sharing in the ecstasy ; 
I would fare like that or this, 
Find my wisdom in my bliss ; 
Keep the sprightly soul awake, 
And have faculties to take, 
Even from things by sorrow wrought, 
Matter for a jocund thought, 
Spite of care, and spite of grief, 
To gambol with Life's falling Leaf.

ADDRESS TO MY INFANT DAUGHTER, 
DORA, 
ON BEING REMINDED THAT SHE WAS A MONTH OLD THAT 
DAY, SEPTEMBER . 
Hast thou then survived — 

Mild Offspring of infirm humanity, 
Meek Infant ! among all forlornest things 
The most forlorn — one life of that bright star, 
The second glory of the Heavens ? — Thou hast ; 
Already hast survived that great decay, 
That transformation through the wide earth felt, 
And by all nations. In that Being's sight 
From whom the Race of human kind proceed, 
A thousand years are but as yesterday ; 
And one day's narrow circuit is to Him 
Not less capacious than a thousand years. 
But what is time  What outward glory % neithe 
A measure is of Thee, whose claims extend 
Through 'heaven's eternal year.' — Yet hail to The 
Frail, feeble, Monthling !— by that name, met! 
Thy scanty breathing-time is portioned out 
Not idly. — Hadst thou been of Indian birth, 
Couched on a casual bed of moss and leaves, 
And rudely canopied by leafy boughs, 
Or to the churlish elements exposed 
On the blank plains, — the coldness of the night, 
Or the night's darkness, or its cheerful face 
Of beauty, by the changing moon adorned, 
Would, with imperious admonition, then 
Have scored thine age, and punctually timed 
Thine infant history, on the minds of those 
Who might have wandered with thee. — Mother 
love, 
Nor less than mother's love in other breasts, 
Will, among us warm- clad and warmly housed, 
Do for thee what the finger of the heavens 
Doth all too often harshly execute 
For thy unblest coevals, amid wilds 
Where fancy hath small liberty to grace 
The affections, to exalt them or refine ; 
And the maternal sympathy itself, 
Though strong, is, in the main, a joyless tie 
Of naked instinct, wound about the heart. 
Happier, far happier is thy lot and ours ! 
Even now — to solemnise thy helpless state, 
And to enliven in the mind's regard 
Thy passive beauty — parallels have risen, 
Resemblances, or contrasts, that connect, 
Within the region of a father's thoughts, 
Thee and thy mate and sister of the sky. 
And first ; — thy sinless progress, through a world 
By sorrow darkened and by care disturbed, 
Apt likeness bears to hers, through gathered clouds, 

THE WAGGONER. 

 

: Moving untouched in silver purity, 
I And cheering oft-times their reluctant gloom. 
Fair are ye both, and both are free from stain : 
( But thou, how leisurely thou fill'st thy horn 
With brightness ! leaving her to post along, 
j And range about, disquieted in change, 
And still impatient of the shape she wears. 
Once up, once down the hill, one journey, Babe 
That will suffice thee ; and it seems that now 
! Thou hast fore-knowledge that such task is thine : 
Thou travellest so contentedly, and sleep'st 
In such a heedless peace. Alas ! full soon 
'■ Hath this conception, grateful to behold, 
Changed countenance, like an object sullied o'er 
By breathing mist; and thine appears to be 

A mournful labour, while to her is given 
Hope, and a renovation without end. 
— That smile forbids the thought; for on thy face 
Smiles are beginning, like the beams of dawn, 
To shoot and circulate ; smiles have there been seen ; 
Tranquil assurances that Heaven supports 
The feeble motions of thy life, and cheers 
Thy loneliness : or shall those smiles be called 
Feelers of love, put forth as if to explore 
This untried world, and to prepare thy way 
Through a strait passage intricate and dim ? 
Such are they; and the same are tokens, signs, 
Which, when the appointed season hath arrived, 
Joy, as her holiest language, shall adopt ; 
And Reason's godlike Power be proud to own.

THE WAGGONER. 
In Cairo's crowded streets 
The impatient Merchant, wondering, waits in vain, 
And Mecca saddens at the long delay.

CHARLES LAMB, ESQ,. 
My Dear Friend, 
When I sent you, a few weeks ago, the Tale of Peter Bell, you asked ' why The Waggoner was not added ? ' 
— To say the truth, — from the higher tone of imagination, and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the former, I 
apprehended, this little Piece could not accompany it without disadvantage. In the year , if I am not mistaken, 
The Waggoner was read to you in manuscript, and, as you have rememhered it for so long a time, I am the more 
encouraged to hope, that, since the localities on which the Poem partly depends did not prevent its being interesting 
to you, it may prove acceptable to others. Being therefore in some measure the cause of its present appearance, you 
must allow me the gratification of inscribing it to you ; in acknowledgment of the pleasure I have derived from your 
Writings, and of the high esteem with which I am very truly yours, 
WILLIAM WORDSWORTH. 
Rydal Mount, May , . 

CANTO FIRST. 
'Tis spent — this burning day of June ! 
Soft darkness o'er its latest gleams is stealing ; 
The buzzing dor-hawk, round and round, is wheel- 
ing,— 
That solitary bird 
Is all that can be heard 
In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon ! 
Confiding Glow-worms, 'tis a night 
Propitious to your earth-bom light ! 
But, where the scattered stars are seen 
In hazy straits the clouds between, 
Each, in his station twinkling not, 
Seems changed into a pallid spot. 
The mountains against heaven's grave weight 
Rise up, and grow to wondrous height. 

The air, as in a lion's den, 
Is close and hot ; — and now and then 
Comes a tired and sultry breeze 
With a haunting and a panting, 
Like the stifling of disease ; 
But the dews allay the heat, 
And the silence makes it sweet. 
Hush, there is some one on the stir ! 
'Tis Benjamin the Waggoner ; 
Who long hath trod this toilsome way, 
Companion of the night and day. 
That far-off tinkling's drowsy cheer, 
Mix'd with a faint yet grating sound 
In a moment lost and found, 
The Wain announces — by whose side 
Along the banks of Rydal Mere 
He paces on, a trusty Guide, — 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

Listen ! you can scarcely hear ! 
Hither he his course is bending ; — 
Now he leaves the lower ground, 
And up the craggy hill ascending 
Many a stop and stay he makes, 
Many a breathing-fit he takes ; — 
Steep the way and wearisome, 
Yet all the while his whip is dumb ! 
The Horses have worked with right good-will, 
And so have gained the top of the hill ; 
He was patient, they were strong, 
And now they smoothly glide along, 
Recovering breath, and pleased to win 
The praises of mild Benjamin. 
Heaven shield him from mishap and snare ! 
But why so early with this prayer ? — 
Is it for threatenings in the sky ? 
Or for some other danger nigh ? 
No ; none is near him yet, though he 
Be one of much infirmity ; 
For at the bottom of the brow, 
Where once the Dove and Olive-bough 
Offered a greeting of good ale 
To all who entered Grasmere Vale ; 
And called on him who must depart 
To leave it with a jovial heart ; 
There, where the Dove and Olive-bough 
Once hung, a Poet harbours now, 
A simple water-drinking Bard ; 
Why need our Hero then (though frail 
His best resolves) be on his guard ? 
He marches by, secure and bold ; 
Yet while he thinks on times of old, 
It seems that all looks wondrous cold ; 
He shrugs his shoulders, shakes his head, 
And, for the honest folk within, 
It is a doubt with Benjamin 
Whether they be alive or dead ! 
Here is no danger, — none at all ! 
Beyond his wish he walks secure ; 
But pass a mile — and then for trial, — 
Then for the pride of self-denial ; 
If he resist that tempting door, 
Which with such friendly voice will call ; 
If he resist those casement panes, 
And that bright gleam which thence will fall 
Upon his Leaders' bells and manes, 
Inviting him with cheerful lure : 
For still, though all be dark elsewhere, 
Some shining notice will be there, 
Of open house and ready fare. 

The place to Benjamin right well 
Is known, and by as strong a spell 
As used to be that sign of love 
And hope — the Olive-bough and Dove ; 
He knows it to his cost, good Man ! 
Who does not know the famous Swan ? 
Object uncouth ! and yet our boast, 
For it was painted by the Host ; 
His own conceit the figure planned, 
'Twas coloured all by his own hand ; 
And that frail Child of thirsty clay, 
Of whom I sing this rustic lay, 
Could tell with self-dissatisfaction 
Quaint stories of the bird's attraction ! 
Well ! that is past — and in despite 
Of open door and shining light. 
And now the conqueror essays 
The long ascent of Dunmail-raise ; 
And with his team is gentle here 
As when he clomb from Rydal Mere ; 
His whip they do not dread — his voice 
They only hear it to rejoice. 
To stand or go is at their pleasure ; 
Their efforts and their time they measure 
By generous pride within the breast ; 
And, while they strain, and while they rest, 
He thus pursues his thoughts at leisure. 
Now am I fairly safe to-night — 
And with proud cause my heart is light : 
I trespassed lately worse than ever — 
But Heaven has blest a good endeavour ; 
And, to my soul's content, I find 
The evil One is left behind. 
Yes, let my master fume and fret, 
Here am I — with my horses yet ! 
My jolly team, he finds that ye 
Will work for nobody but me ! 
Full proof of this the Country gained ; 
It knows how ye were vexed and strained, 
And forced unworthy stripes to bear, 
When trusted to another's care. 
Here was it — on this rugged slope, 
Which now ye climb with heart and hope. 
I saw you, between rage and fear, 
Plunge, and fling back a spiteful ear, 
And ever more and more confused, 
As ye were more and more abused : 
As chance would have it, passing by 
I saw you in that jeopardy : 

 This rude piece of self-taught art (such is the progress 
of refinement) has been supplanted by a professional pro- 
duction. 

THE WAGGONER. 

- 

A word from me was like a charm ; 
Ye pulled together with one mind ; 
And your huge burthen, safe from harm, 
Moved like a vessel in the wind ! 
— Yes, without me, up hills so high 
'Tis vain to strive for mastery. 
Then grieve not, jolly team ! though tough 
The road we travel, steep, and rough ; 
Though Rydal-heights and Dunmail-raise, 
And all their fellow banks and braes, 
Full often make you stretch and strain, 
And halt for breath and halt again, 
Yet to their sturdiness 'tis owing 
That side by side we still are going ! 
While Benjamin in earnest mood 
His meditations thus pursued, 
A storm, which had been smothered long, 
Was growing inwardly more strong ; 
And, in its struggles to get free, 
Was busily employed as he. 
The thunder had begun to growl- 
He heard not, too intent of soul ; 
The air was now without a breath — 
He marked not that 'twas still as death. 
But soon large rain-drops on his head 
Fell with the weight of drops of lead ; — 
He starts — and takes, at the admonition, 
A sage survey of his condition. 
The road is black before his eyes, 
Glimmering faintly where it lies ; 
Black is the sky — and every hill, 
Up to the sky, is blacker still — 
Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room, 
Hung round and overhung with gloom ; 
Save that above a single height 
Is to be seen a lurid light, 
Above Helm-crag — a streak half dead, 
A burning of portentous red ; 
And near that lurid light, full well 
The Astrologer, sage Sidrophel, 
Where at his desk and book he sits, 
Puzzling aloft his curious wits ; 
He whose domain is held in common 
With no one but the ancient woman, 
Cowering beside her rifted cell, 
As if intent on magic spell ; — 
Dread pair, that, spite of wind and weather, 
Still sit upon Helm- crag together ! 

 A mountain of Grasmere, the broken summit of which 
presents two figures, full as distinctly shaped as that of the 
famous Cobbler near Arroquhar in Scotland. 

The Astrologer was not unseen 
By solitary Benjamin ; 
But total darkness came anon, 
And he and every thing was gone : 
And suddenly a ruffling breeze, 
(That would have rocked the sounding trees 
Had aught of sylvan growth been there) 
Swept through the Hollow long and bare : 
The rain rushed down — the road was battered, 
As with the force of billows shattered ; 
The horses are dismayed, nor know 
Whether they should stand or go ; 
And Benjamin is groping near them, 
Sees nothing, and can scarcely hear them. 
He is astounded, — wonder not, — 
With such a charge in such a spot ; 
Astounded in the mountain gap 
With thunder-peals, clap after clap, 
Close-treading on the silent flashes — 
And somewhere, as he thinks, by crashes 
Among the rocks ; with weight of rain, 
And sullen motions long and slow, 
That to a dreary distance go — 
Till, breaking in upon the dying strain, 
A rending o'er his head begins the fray again. 
Meanwhile, uncertain what to do, 
And oftentimes compelled to halt, 
The horses cautiously pursue 
Their way, without mishap or fault ; 
And now have reached that pile of stones, 
Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones ; 
He who had once supreme command, 
Last king of rocky Cumberland ; 
His bones, and those of all his Power, 
Slain here in a disastrous hour ! 
When, passing through this narrow strait, 
Stony, and dark, and desolate, 
Benjamin can faintly hear 
A voice that comes from some one near, 
A female voice : — " Whoe'er you be, 
Stop," it exclaimed, (i and pity me " 
And, less in pity than in wonder, 
Amid the darkness and the thunder, 
The Waggoner, with prompt command, 
Summons his horses to a stand. 
While, with increasing agitation, 
The Woman urged her supplication, 
In rueful words, with sobs between — 
The voice of tears that fell unseen ; 
There came a flash — a startling glare, 
And all Seat-Sandal was laid bare ! 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

'Tis not a time for nice suggestion, 
And Benjamin, without a question, 
Taking her for some way-worn rover, 
Said, " Mount, and get you under cover !" 
Another voice, in tone as hoarse 
As a swoln brook with rugged course, 
Cried out, " Good brother, why so fast ? 
I 've had a glimpse of you — avast I 
Or, since it suits you to be civil, 
Take her at once — for good and evil !" 
w It is my Husband," softly said 
The Woman, as if half afraid : 
By this time she was snug within, 
Through help of honest Benjamin ; 
She and her Babe, which to her breast 
With thankfulness the Mother pressed ; 
And now the same strong voice more near 
Said cordially, " My Friend, what cheer ? 
Rough doings these ! as God's my judge, 
The sky owes somebody a grudge ! 
We 've had in half an hour or less 
A twelvemonth's terror and distress !" 
Then Benjamin entreats the Man 
Would mount, too, quickly as he can : 
The Sailor — Sailor now no more, 
But such he had been heretofore — 
To courteous Benjamin replied, 
" Go you your way, and mind not me ; 
For I must have, whate'er betide, 
My Ass and fifty things beside, — 
Go, and I ' follow speedily !" 
The Waggon moves — and with its load 
Descends along the sloping road ; 
And the rough Sailor instantly 
Turns to a little tent hard by : 
For when, at closing-in of day, 
The family had come that way, 
Green pasture and the soft warm air 
Tempted them to settle there. — 
Green is the grass for beast to graze, 
Around the stones of Dunmail-raise ! 
The Sailor gathers up his bed, 
Takes down the canvass overhead ; 
And, after farewell to the place, 
A parting word — though not of grace, 
Pursues, with Ass and all his store, 
The way the Waggon went before. 

CANTO SECOND. 
If Wytheburn's modest House of prayer, 
As lowly as the lowliest dwelling, 
Had, with its belfry's humble stock, 
A little pair that hang in air, 
Been mistress also of a clock, 
(And one, too, not in crazy plight) 
Twelve strokes that clock would have been telling 
Under the brow of old Helvellyn — 
Its bead-roll of midnight, 
Then, when the Hero of my tale 
Was passing by, and, down the vale 
(The vale now silent, hushed I ween 
As if a storm had never been) 
Proceeding with a mind at ease ; 
While the old Familiar of the seas 
Intent to use his utmost haste, 
Gained ground upon the Waggon fast, 
And gives another lusty cheer ; 
For spite of rumbling of the wheels, 
A welcome greeting he can hear ; — 
It is a fiddle in its glee 
Dinning from the Cherry Tree ! 
Thence the sound — the light is there— 
As Benjamin is now aware, 
Who, to his inward thoughts confined, 
Had almost reached the festive door, 
When, startled by the Sailor's roar, 
He hears a sound and sees the light, 
And in a moment calls to mind 
That 'tis the village Merry-night ! 
Although before in no dejection, 
At this insidious recollection 
His heart with sudden joy is filled, — 
His ears are by the music thrilled, 
His eyes take pleasure in the road 
Glittering before him bright and broad ; 
And Benjamin is wet and cold, 
And there are reasons manifold 
That make the good, tow'rds which he 's yearning, 
Look fairly like a lawful earning. 
Nor has thought time to come and go, 
To vibrate between yes and no ; 
For, cries the Sailor, " Glorious chance 
That blew us hither ! — let him dance, 
Who can or will ! — my honest soul, 
Our treat shall be a friendly bowl ! " 

 A term well known in the North of England, and 
applied to rural Festivals where young persons meet in 
the evening for the purpose of dancing. 

THE WAGGONER. 

 

He draws him to the door — " Come in, 
Come, come," cries he to Benjamin ! 
And Benjamin — ah, woe is me ! 
Gave the word — the horses heard 
And halted, though reluctantly. 
' Blithe souls and lightsome hearts have we, 
Feasting at the Cheery Tree !' 
This was the outside proclamation, 
This was the inside salutation ; 
What bustling— jostling— high and low ! 
A universal overflow ! 
i What tankards foaming from the tap ! 
' What store of cakes in every lap ! 
; What thumping — stumping — overhead ! 
The thunder had not been more busy : 
With such a stir you would have said, 
This little place may well be dizzy ! 
'Tis who can dance with greatest vigour — 
'Tis what can be most prompt and eager ; 
As if it heard the fiddle's call, 
The pewter clatters on the wall ; 
The very bacon shows it feeling, 
Swinging from the smoky ceiling ! 
A steaming bowl, a blazing fire, 
What greater good can heart desire ? 
'Twere worth a wise man's while to try 
The utmost anger of the sky : 
To seek for thoughts of a gloomy cast, 
If such the bright amends at last. 
Now should you say I judge amiss, 
The Cherry Tree shows proof of this ; 
For soon of all the happy there, 
Our Travellers are the happiest pair ; 
All care with Benjamin is gone — 
A Caesar past the Rubicon ! 
He thinks not of his long, long, strife ; — 
The Sailor, Man by nature gay, 
Hath no resolves to throw away ; 
And he hath now forgot his Wife, 
Hath quite forgotten her — or may be 
Thinks her the luckiest soul on earth, 
Within that warm and peaceful berth, 
Under cover, 
Terror over, 
Sleeping by her sleeping Baby. 
With bowl that sped from hand to hand, 
The gladdest of the gladsome band, 
Amid their own delight and fun, 
They hear— when every dance is done, 
When every whirling bout is o'er — 

The fiddle's squeak — that call to bliss, 
Ever followed by a kiss ; 
They envy not the happy lot, 
But enjoy their own the more ! 
While thus our jocund Travellers fare, 
Up springs the Sailor from his chair — 
Limps (for I might have told before 
That he was lame) across the floor- — 
Is gone — returns — and with a prize ; 
With what ? — a Ship of lusty size ; 
A gallant stately Man-of-war, 
Fixed on a smoothly-sliding car. 
Surprise to all, but most surprise 
To Benjamin, who rubs his eyes, 
Not knowing that he had befriended 
A Man so gloriously attended ! 
" This," cries the Sailor, " a Third-rate is — 
Stand back, and you shall see her gratis ! 
This was the Flag-ship at the Nile, 
The Vanguard — you may smirk and smile, 
But, pretty Maid, if you look near, 
You ' find you 've much in little here ! 
A nobler ship did never swim, 
And you shall see her in full trim : 
I'll set, my friends, to do you honour, 
Set every inch of sail upon her." 
So said, so done ; and masts, sails, yards, 
He names them all ; and interlards 
His speech with uncouth terms of art, 
Accomplished in the showman's part ; 
And then, as from a sudden check, 
Cries out — " 'Tis there, the quarter-deck 
On which brave Admiral Nelson stood — 
A sight that would have roused your blood ! 
One eye he had, which, bright as ten, 
Burned like a fire among his men ; 
Let this be land, and that be sea, 
Here lay the French — and thus came we ! " 
Hushed was by this the fiddle's sound, 
The dancers aU were gathered round, 
And, such the stillness of the house, 
You might have heard a nibbling mouse : 
While, borrowing helps where'er he may, 
The Sailor through the story runs 
Of ships to ships and guns to guns ; 
And does his utmost to display 
The dismal conflict, and the might 
And terror of that marvellous night ! 

 At the close of each strathspey, or jig, a particular 
note from the fiddle summons the Rustic to the agreeable 
duty of saluting liis partner. 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

" A bowl, a bowl of double measure," 

Can any low-born care pursue her, 

Cries Benjamin, " a draught of length, 

Can any mortal clog come to her? 

To Nelson, England's pride and treasure, 

No notion have they — not a thought, 

Her bulwark and her tower of strength ! " 

That is from joyless regions brought ! 

When Benjamin had seized the bowl, 

And, while they coast the silent lake, 

The mastiff, from beneath the waggon, 

Then.' inspiration I partake ; . 

Where he lay, watchful as a dragon, 

Share their empyreal spirits — yea, 

Rattled his chain ; — 'twas all in vain, 

With their enraptured vision, see — 

For Benjamin, triumphant soul ! 

fancy — what a jubilee ! 

He heard the monitory growl ; 

What shifting pictures — clad in gleams 

Heard — and in opposition quaffed 

Of colour bright as feverish dreams ! 

A deep, determined, desperate draught ! 

Earth, spangled sky, and lake serene, 

Nor did the battered Tar forget, 

Involved and restless all — a scene 

Or flinch from what he deemed his debt : 

Pregnant with mutual exaltation, 

Then, like a hero crowned with laurel, 

Rich change, and multiplied creation ! 

Back to her place the ship he led ; 

This sight to me the Muse imparts ; — 

Wheeled her back in full apparel ; 

And then, what kindness in their hearts ! 

And so, flag flying at mast head, 

What tears of rapture, what vow-making, 

Re-yoked her to the Ass : — anon, 

Profound entreaties, and hand-shaking ! 

Cries Benjamin, " We must be gone." 

What solemn, vacant, interlacing, 

Thus, after two hours' hearty stay, 

As if they 'd fall asleep embracing ! 

Again behold them on their way ! 

Then, in the turbulence of glee, 


And in the excess of amity, 
Says Benjamin, " That Ass of thine, 



He spoils thy sport, and hinders mine : 

CANTO THIRD. 

If he were tethered to the waggon, 

Right gladly had the horses stirred, 

He 'd drag as well what he is dragging ; 

When they the wished-for greeting heard, 

And we, as brother should with brother 

The whip's loud notice from the door, 

Might trudge it alongside each other ! " 

That they were free to move once more. 


You think, those doings must have bred 

Forthwith, obedient to command, 

In them disheartening doubts and dread ; 

The horses made a quiet stand ; 

No, not a horse of all the eight, 

And to the waggon's skirts was tied 

Although it be a moonless night, 

The Creature, by the Mastiff's side, 

Fears either for himself or freight ; 

The Mastiff wondering, and perplext 

For this they know (and let it hide, 

With dread of what will happen next ; 

In part, the offences of their guide) 

And thinking it but sorry cheer, 

That Benjamin, with clouded brains, 

To have such company so near ! 

Is worth the best with all their pains ; 


And, if they had a prayer to make, 

This new arrangement made, the Wain 

The prayer would be that they may take 

Through the still night proceeds again ; 

With him whatever comes in course, 

No Moon hath risen her light to lend ; 

The better fortune or the worse ; 

But indistinctly may be kenned 

That no one else may have business near them, 

The Vanguard, following close behind, 

And, drank or sober, he may steer them. 

Sails spread, as if to catch the wind ! 

So, forth in dauntless mood they fare, 

" Thy wife and child are snug and warm, 

And with them goes the guardian pair. 

Thy ship will travel without harm ; 


I like," said Benjamin, u her shape and stature : 

Now, heroes, for the time commotion, 

And this of mine — this bulky creature 

The triumph of your late devotion ! 

Of which I have the steering — this, 

Can aught on earth impede delight, 

Seen fairly, is not much amiss ! 

Still mounting to a higher height ; 

We want your streamers, friend, you know; 

And higher still — a greedy flight ! 

But, altogether as we go, 

THE WAGGONER. 

 

We make a land of handsome show ! 
Among these hills, from first to last, 
We 've weathered many a furious blast ; 
Hard passage forcing on, with head 
Against the storm, and canvass spread. 
I hate a boaster ; but to thee 
Will say 't, who know'st both land and sea, 
The unluckiest hulk that stems the brine 
Is hardly worse beset than mine, 
When cross-winds on her quarter beat ; 
And, fairly lifted from my feet, 
I stagger onward — heaven knows how ; 
But not so pleasantly as now : 
Poor pilot I, by snows confounded, 
And many a foundrous pit surrounded ! 
Yet here we are, by night and day 
Grinding through rough and smooth our way ; 
Through foul and fair our task fulfilling ; 
And long shall be so yet — God willing !" 
" Ay," said the Tar, through fair and foul — 
But save us from yon screeching owl ! " 
That instant was begun a fray 
Which called their thoughts another way : 
The mastiff, ill-conditioned carl ! 
What must he do but growl aud snarl, 
Still more and more dissatisfied 
With the meek comrade at his side ! 
Till, not incensed though put to proof, 
The Ass, uplifting a hind hoof, 
Salutes the Mastiff on the head ; 
And so were better manners bred, 
And all was calmed and quieted. 
u Yon screech-owl," says the Sailor, turning 
Back to his former cause of mourning, 
" Yon owl ! — pray God that all be well ! 
'Tis worse than any funeral bell ; 
As sure as I 've the gift of sight, 
We shall be meeting ghosts to-night !" 
— Said Benjamin, " This whip shall lay 
A thousand, if they cross our way. 
I know that Wanton's noisy station, 
I know him and his occupation ; 
The jolly bird hath learned his cheer 
Upon the banks of Windermere ; 
Where a tribe of them make merry, 
Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry ; 
Hallooing from an open throat, 
Like travellers shouting for a boat. 
— The tricks he learned at Windermere 
This vagrant owl is playing here — 
I That is the worst of his employment : 
He 's at the top of his enjoyment !" 

This explanation stilled the alarm, 
Cured the foreboder like a charm ; 
This, and the manner, and the voice, 
Summoned the Sailor to rejoice ; 
His heart is up — he fears no evil 
From life or death, from man or devil ; 
He wheels — and, making many stops, 
Brandished his crutch against the mountain tops ; 
And, while he talked of blows and scars, 
Benjamin, among the stars, 
Beheld a dancing — and a glancing ; 
Such retreating and advancing 
As, I ween, was never seen 
In bloodiest battle since the days of Mars ! 

CANTO FOURTH. 
Thus they, with freaks of proud delight, 
Beguile the remnant of the night ; 
And many a snatch of jovial song 
Regales them as they wind along ; 
While to the music, from on high, 
The echoes make a glad reply. — 
But the sage Muse the revel heeds 
No farther than her story needs ; 
Nor will she servilely attend 
The loitering journey to its end. 
— Blithe spirits of her own impel 
The Muse, who scents the morning air, 
To take of this transported pair 
A brief and unreproved farewell ; 
To quit the slow-paced waggon's side, 
And wander down yon hawthorn dell, 
With murmuring Greta for her guide. 
— There doth she ken the awful form 
Of Raven-crag — black as a storm — 
Glimmering through the twilight pale ; 
And Ghimmer-crag, his tall twin brother, 
Each peering forth to meet the other : — 
And, while she roves through St. John's Vale, 
Along the smooth unpathwayed plain, 
By sheep-track or through cottage lane, 
Where no disturbance comes to intrude 
Upon the pensive solitude, 
Her unsuspecting eye, perchance, 
With the rude shepherd's favoured glance, 
Beholds the faeries in array, 
Whose party-coloured garments gay 
The silent company betray : 
Red, green, and blue ; a moment's sight  
For Skiddaw-top with rosy light 
Is touched — and all the band take flight. 

 The crag of the ewe lamb. 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

— Fly also, Muse ! and from the dell 
Mount to the ridge of Nathdale Fell ; 
Thence, look thou forth o'er wood and lawn 
Hoar with the frost-like dews of dawn ; 
Across yon meadowy hottom look, 
Where close fogs hide their parent hrook ; 
And see, beyond that hamlet small, 
The ruined towers of Threlkeld-hall, 
Lurking in a double shade, 
By trees and lingering twilight made ! 
There, at Blencathara's rugged feet, 
Sir Lancelot gave a safe retreat 
To noble Clifford ; from annoy 
Concealed the persecuted boy, 
Well pleased in rustic garb to feed 
His flock, and pipe on shepherd's reed 
Among this multitude of hills, 
Crags, woodlands, waterfalls, and rills ; 
Which soon the morning shall enfold, 
From east to west, in ample vest 
Of massy gloom and radiance bold. 
The mists, that o'er the streamlet's bed 
Hung low, begin to rise and spread ; 
Even while I speak, their skirts of grey 
Are smitten by a silver ray ; 
And lo ! — up Castrigg's naked steep 
(Where, smoothly urged, the vapours sweep 
Along — and scatter and divide, 
Like fleecy clouds self-multiplied) 
The stately waggon is ascending, 
With faithful Benjamin attending, 
Apparent now beside his team — 
Now lost amid a glittering steam : 
And with him goes his Sailor-friend, 
By this time near their journey's end ; 
And, after their high-minded riot, 
Sickening into thoughtful quiet ; 
As if the morning's pleasant hour, 
Had for their joys a killing power. 
And, sooth, for Benjamin a vein 
Is opened of still deeper pain 
As if his heart by notes were stung 
From out the lowly hedge-rows flung ; 
As if the warbler lost in light 
Reproved his soarings of the night, 
In strains of rapture pure and holy 
Upbraided his distempered folly. 
Drooping is he, his step is dull ; 
But the horses stretch and pull ; 
With increasing vigour climb, 
Eager to repair lost time ; 
Whether, by their own desert, 

Knowing what cause there is for shame, 
They are labouring to avert 
As much as may be of the blame, 
Which, they foresee, must soon alight 
Upon his head, whom, in despite 
Of all his failings, they love best ; 
Whether for him they are distrest, 
Or, by length of fasting roused, 
Are impatient to be housed : 
Up against the hill they strain 
Tugging at the iron chain, 
Tugging all with might and main, 
Last and foremost, every horse 
To the utmost of his force ! 
And the smoke and respiration, 
Rising like an exhalation, 
Blend with the mist — a moving shroud 
To form, an undissolving cloud ; 
Which, with slant ray, the merry sun 
Takes delight to play upon. 
Never golden-haired Apollo, 
Pleased some favourite chief to follow 
Through accidents of peace or war, 
In a perilous moment threw 
Around the object of his care 
Veil of such celestial hue ; 
Interposed so bright a screen — 
Him and his enemies between ! 
Alas ! what boots it ? — who can hide, 
When the malicious Fates are bent 
On working out an ill intent ? 
Can destiny be turned aside  
No — sad progress of my story ! 
Benjamin, this outward glory 
Cannot shield thee from thy Master, 
Who from Keswick has pricked forth, 
Sour and surly as the north ; 
And, in fear of some disaster, 
Comes to give what help he may, 
And to hear what thou canst say ; 
If, as needs he must forebode, 
Thou hast been loitering on the road ! 
His fears, his doubts, may now take flight — 
The wished-for object is in sight ; 
Yet, trust the Muse, it rather hath 
Stirred him up to livelier wrath ; 
Which he stifles, moody man ! 
With all the patience that he can ; 
To the end that, at your meeting, 
He may give thee decent greeting. 
There he is — resolved to stop, 
Till the waggon gains the top ; 

THE WAGGONER. 

 

Put stop he cannot — must advance : 
Him Benjamin, with lucky glance, 
Espies — and instantly is ready, 
Self-collected, poised, and steady : 
And, to he the hetter seen, 
Issues from his radiant shroud, 
From his close-attending cloud, 
With careless air and open mien. 
Erect his port, and firm his going ; 
So struts yon cock that now is crowing ; 
And the morning light in grace 
Strikes upon his lifted face, 
Hurrying the pallid hue away 
That might his trespasses betray. 
But what can all avail to clear him, 
Or what need of explanation, 
Parley or interrogation ? 
For the Master sees, alas ! 
That unhappy Figure near him, 
'Limping o'er the dewy grass, 
Where the road it fringes, sweet, 
Soft and cool to way-worn feet; 
And, indignity ! an Ass, 
By his noble Mastiff's side, 
Tethered to the waggon's tail : 
And the ship, in all her pride, 
Following after in full sail ! 
Not to speak of babe and mother ; 
Who, contented with each other, 
And snug as birds in leafy arbour, 
Find, within, a blessed harbour ! 

With eager eyes the Master pries ; 
(Looks in and out, and through and through : 
Says nothing — till at last he spies 
A wound upon the Mastiff's head, 
A wound, where plainly might be read 
What feats an Ass's hoof can do ! 
But drop the rest : — this aggravation, 
This complicated provocation, 
A. hoard of grievances unsealed ; 
All past forgiveness it repealed ; 
And thus, and through distempered blood 
On both sides, Benjamin the good, 
The patient, and the tender-hearted, 
Was from his team and waggon parted ; 
When duty of that day was o'er, 
Laid down his whip — and served no more.— 
Nor could the waggon long survive, 
j Which Benjamin had ceased to drive : 
ilt lingered on ; — guide after guide 
(Ambitiously the office tried ; 
;But each unmanageable hill 
] Called for his patience and his skill ; — 

And sure it is, that through this night, 
And what the morning brought to light, 
Two losses had we to sustain, 
We lost both Waggoner and Wain ! 

Accept, Friend, for praise or blame, 
The gift of this adventurous song ; 
A record which I dared to frame, 
Though timid scruples checked me long ; 
They checked me — and I left the theme 
Untouched ; — in spite of many a gleam 
Of fancy which thereon was shed, 
Like pleasant sunbeams shifting still 
Upon the side of a distant hill : 
But Nature might not be gainsaid ; 
For what I have and what I miss 
I sing of these ; — it makes my bliss ! 
Nor is it I who play the part, 
But a shy spirit in my heart, 
That comes and goes — will sometimes leap 
From hiding-places ten years deep ; 
Or haunts me with familiar face, 
Returning, like a ghost unlaid, 
Until the debt I owe be paid. 
Forgive me, then ; for I had been 
On friendly terms with this Machine : 
In him, while he was wont to trace 
Our roads, through many a long year's space, 
A living almanack had we; 
We had a speaking diary, 
That in this uneventful place, 
Gave to the days a mark and name 
By which we knew them when they came. 
— Yes, I, and all about me here, 
Through all the changes of the year, 
Had seen him through the mountains go, 
In pomp of mist or pomp of snow, 
Majestically huge and slow : 
Or, with a milder grace adorning 
The landscape of a summer's morning ; 
While Grasmere smoothed her liquid plain 
The moving image to detain; 
And mighty Fairfield, with a chime 
Of echoes, to his march kept time ; 
When little other business stirred, 
And little other sound was heard ; 
In that delicious hour of balm, 
Stillness, solitude, and calm, 
While yet the valley is arrayed, 
On this side with a sober shade ; 
On that is prodigally bright — 
Crag, lawn, and wood — with rosy light. 

 

POEMS OF THE FANCY. 

— But most of all, thou lordly Wain ! 
I wish to have thee here again, 
When windows flap and chimney roars, 
And all is dismal out of doors ; 
And, sitting by my fire, I see 
Eight sorry carts, no less a train ! 
Unworthy successors of thee, 
Come straggling through the wind and rain : 
And oft, as they pass slowly on, 
Beneath my windows, one by one, 
See, perched upon the naked height 
The summit of a cumbrous freight, 
A single traveller — and there 
Another ; then perhaps a pair — 

The lame, the sickly, and the old ; 
Men, women, heartless with the cold ; 
And babes in wet and starveling plight ;. 
Which once, be weather as it might, 
Had still a nest within a nest, 
Thy shelter — and their mother's breast ! 
Then most of all, then far the most, 
Do I regret what we have lost ; 
Am grieved for that unhappy sin 
Which robbed us of good Benjamin ; — ■ 
And of his stately Charge, which none 
Could keep alive when He was gone ! 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

THERE WAS A BOY. 
There was a Boy ; ye knew him well, ye cliffs 
And islands of Winander ! — many a time, 
At evening, when the earliest stars began 
To move along the edges of the hills, 
Rising or setting, would he stand alone, 
Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake ; 
And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands 
Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth 
Uplifted, he, as through an instrument, 
Blew mim ic hootings to the silent owls, 
That they might answer him. — And they would shout 
Across the watery vale, and shout again, 
Responsive to Ms call, — with quivering peals, 
And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud 
Redoubled and redoubled ; concourse wild 
Of jocund din ! And, when there came a pause 
Of silenco such as baffled his best skill : 
Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung 
Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise 
Has carried far into his heart the voice 
Of mountain-torrents ; or the visible scene 
Would enter unawares into his mind 
With all its solemn imagery, its rocks, 
Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received 
Into the bosom of the steady lake. 
This boy was taken from his mates, and died 
In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old. 
Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale 
Where he was born and bred : the church-yard hangs 
Upon a slope above the village-school ; 
And, through that church-yard when my way has led 
On summer-evenings, I believe, that there 
A long half-hour together I have stood 
Mute — looking at the grave in which he lies ! 
- 

TO THE CUCKOO. 
blithe New-comer ! I have heard, 
 hear thee and rejoice. 
Cuckoo ! shall I call thee Bird, 
Or but a wandering Voice ? 

While I am lying on the grass 
Thy twofold shout I hear, 
From hill to hill it seems to pass, 
At once far off, and near. 
Though babbling only to the Vale, 
Of sunshine and of flowers, 
Thou bringest unto me a tale 
Of visionary hours. 
Thrice welcome, darling of the Spring ! 
Even yet thou art to me 
No bird, but an invisible tiling, 
A voice, a mystery ; 
The same whom in my school-boy days 
I listened to ; that Cry 
Which made me look a thousand ways 
In bush, and tree, and sky. 
To seek thee did I often rove 
Through woods and on the green ; 
And thou wert still a hope, a love ; 
Still longed for, never seen. 
And I can listen to thee yet ; 
Can He upon the plain 
And listen, till I do beget 
That golden time again. 
O blessed Bird ! the earth we pace 
Again appears to be 
An unsubstantial, faery place ; 
That is fit home for Thee ! 

ill. 
A NIGHT-PIECE. 

The sky is overcast 
With a continuous cloud of texture close, 
Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon, 
Which through that veil is indistinctly seen, 
A dull, contracted circle, yielding light 
So feebly spread, that not a shadow falls, 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

Chequering the ground — from rock, plant, tree, or 
tower. 
At length a pleasant instantaneous gleam 
Startles the pensive traveller while he treads 
His lonesome path, with unohserving eye 
Bent earthwards ; he looks up — the clouds are split 
Asunder, — and above his head he sees 
The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens. 
There, in a black-blue vault she sails along, 
Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small 
And sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss 
Drive as she drives : how fast they wheel away, 
Yet vanish not ! — the wind is in the tree, 
But they are silent ; — still they roll along 
Immeasurably distant ; and the vault, 
Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds, 
Still deepens its unfathomable depth. 
At length the Vision closes ; and the mind, 
Not undisturbed by the delight it feels, 
Which slowly settles into peaceful calm, 
Is left to muse upon the solemn scene. 
. 

AIREY-FORCE VALLEY. 
Not a breath of air 

Ruffles the bosom of this leafy glen. 
From the brook's margin, wide around, the trees 
Are stedfast as the rocks ; the brook itself, 
Old as the hills that feed it from afar, 
Doth rather deepen than disturb the calm 
Where all things else are still and motionless. 
And yet, even now, a little breeze, perchance 
Escaped from boisterous winds that rage without, 
Has entered, by the sturdy oaks unfelt, 
But to its gentle touch how sensitive 
Is the light ash ! that, pendent from the brow 
Of yon dim cave, in seeming silence makes 
A soft eye-music of slow-waving boughs, 
Powerful almost as vocal harmony 
To stay the wanderer's steps and soothe his thoughts.
