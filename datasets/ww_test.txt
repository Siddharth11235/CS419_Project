 the Ass to reach his home, 
Is striving stoutly as he may ; 
But, while he climbs the woody hill, 
The cry grows weak — and weaker still ; 
And now at last it dies away. 
So with his freight the Creature turns 
Into a gloomy grove of beech, 
Along the shade with footsteps true 
Descending slowly, till the two 
The open moonlight reach. 
And there, along the narrow dell, 
A fair smooth pathway you discern, 
A length of green and open road— 
As if it from a fountain flowed — 
Winding away between the fern. 
The rocks that tower on either side 
Build up a wild fantastic scene ; 
Temples like those among the Hindoos, 
And mosques, and spires, and abbey windows, 
And castles all with ivy green ! 
And, while the Ass pursues his way, 
Along this solitary dell, 
As pensively his steps advance, 
The mosques and spires change countenance, 
And look at Peter Bell ! 
That unintelligible cry 
Hath left him high in preparation, — 
Convinced that he, or soon or late, 
This very night will meet his fate — 
And so he sits in expectation ! 
The strenuous Animal hath clomb 
With the green path ; and now he wends 
Where, shining like the smoothest sea, 
In undisturbed immensity 
A level plain extends. 
But whence this faintly-rustling sound 
By which the journeying pair are chased ? 
— A withered leaf is close behind, 
Light plaything for the sportive wind 
Upon that solitary waste. 
When Peter spied the moving thing, 
It only doubled his distress ; 
" Where there is not a bush or tree, 
The very leaves they follow me — 
So huge hath been my wickedness !" 

To a close lane they now are come, 
Where, as before, the enduring Ass 
Moves on without a moment's stop, 
Nor once turns round his head to crop 
A bramble-leaf or blade of grass. 
Between the hedges as they go, 
The white dust sleeps upon the lane ; 
And Peter, ever and anon 
Back-looking, sees, upon a stone, 
Or in the dust, a crimson stain. 



A stain — as of a drop of blood 
By moonlight made more faint and wan ; 
Ha ! why these sinkings of despair ? 
He knows not how the blood comes there— 
And Peter is a wicked man. 
At length he spies a bleeding wound, 
Where he had struck the Ass's head ; 
He sees the blood, knows what it is, — 
A glimpse of sudden joy was his, 
But then it quickly fled ; 
Of him whom sudden death had seized 
He thought, — of thee, faithful Ass ! 
And once again those ghastly pains, 
Shoot to and fro through heart and reins, 
And through his brain like lightning pass. 

PART THIRD. 
I 've heard of one, a gentle Soul, 
Though given to sadness and to gloom, 
And for the fact will vouch, — one night 
It chanced that by a taper's light 
This man was reading in his room ; 
Bending, as you or I might bend 
At night o'er any pious book, 
When sudden blackness overspread 
The snow-white page on which he read, 
And made the good man round him look. 
The chamber walls were dark all round,- 
And to his book he turned again ; 
— The light had left the lonely taper, 
And formed itself upon the paper 
Into large letters — bright and plain ! 
The godly book was in his hand — 
And, on the page, more black than coal, 
Appeared, set forth in strange array, 
A word — which to his dying day 
Perplexed the good man's gentle soul. 

PETER BELL. 

 

The ghostly word, thus plainly seen, 
Did never from his lips depart ; 
But he hath said, poor gentle wight ! 
It brought full many a sin to light 
Out of the bottom of his heart. 
Dread Spirits ! to confound the meek 
Why wander from your course so far, 
Disordering colour, form, and stature ! 
Let good men feel the soul of nature, 
And see things as they are. 
Yet, potent Spirits ! well I know, 
How ye, that play with soul and sense, 
Are not unused to trouble friends 
Of goodness, for most gracious ends — 
And this I speak in reverence ! 
E-ut might I give advice to you, 
Whom in my fear I love so well ; 
From men of pensive virtue go, 
Dread Beings ! and your empire show 
On hearts like that of Peter Bell. 
Your presence often have I felt 
In darkness and the stormy night ; 
And, with like force, if need there be, 
 Ye can put forth your agency 
When earth is calm, and heaven is bright. 
Then, coming from the wayward world, 
: That powerful world in which ye dwell, 
l Come, Spirits of the Mind ! and try 
. To-night, beneath the moonlight sky r , 
' What may be done with Peter Bell ! 
, — , would that some more skilful voice 
My further labour might prevent ! 
Kind Listeners, that around me sit, 
I feel that I am all unfit 
For such high argument. 
I 've played, I 've danced, with my narration ; 
I loitered long ere I began : 
Ye waited then on my good pleasure ; 
Pour out indulgence still, in measure 
As liberal as ye can ! 
Our Travellers, ye remember well, 
Are thridding a sequestered lane ; 
And Peter many tricks is trying, 
And many anodynes applying, 
To ease his conscience of its pain. 

By this his heart is lighter far ; 
And, finding that he can account 
So snugly for that crimson stain, 
His evil spirit up again 
Does like an empty bucket mount. 
And Peter is a deep logician 
Who hath no lack of wit mercurial ; 
" Blood drops — leaves rustle — yet," quoth he, 
" This poor man never, but for me, 
Could have had Christian burial. 
And, say the best you can, 'tis plain, 
That here has been some wicked dealing ; 
No doubt the devil in me wrought ; 
I 'm not the man who could have thought 
An Ass like this was worth the stealing !" 
So from his pocket Peter takes 
His shining horn tobacco-box ; 
And, in a light and careless way, 
As men who with their purpose play, 
Upon the lid he knocks. 
Let them whose voice can stop the clouds, 
Whose cunning eye can see the wind, 
Tell to a curious world the cause 
Why, making here a sudden pause, 
The Ass turned round his head, and grinned. 
Appalling process ! I have marked 
The like on heath, in lonely wood ; 
And, verily, have seldom met 
A spectacle more hideous — yet 
It suited Peter's present mood. 
And, grinning in his turn, his teeth 
He in jocose defiance showed — 
When, to upset his spiteful mirth, 
A murmur, pent within the earth, 
In the dead earth beneath the road, 
Rolled audibly ! it swept along, 
A muffled noise — a rumbling sound ! — 
'Twas by a troop of miners made, 
Plying with gunpowder their trade, 
Some twenty fathoms underground. 
Small cause of dire effect ! for, surely, 
If ever mortal, King or Cotter, 
Believed that earth was charged to quake 
And yawn for his unworthy sake, 
'Twas Peter Bell the Potter. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

But, as an oak in breathless air 
Will stand though to the centre hewn ; 
Or as the weakest things, if frost 
Have stiffened them, maintain their post ; 
So he, beneath the gazing moon !— 
The Beast bestriding thus, he reached 
A spot where, in a sheltering cove, 
A httle chapel stands alone, 
With greenest ivy overgrown, 
And tufted with an ivy grove ; 
Dying insensibly away 
From human thoughts and purposes, 
It seemed — wall, window, roof and tower- 
To bow to some transforming power, 
And blend with the surrounding trees. 
As ruinous a place it was, 
Thought Peter, in the shire of Fife 
That served my turn, when following still 
From land to land a reckless will 
I married my sixth wife ! 
The unheeding Ass moves slowly on, 
And now is passing by an inn 
Brim-full of a carousing crew, 
That make, with curses not a few, 
An uproar and a drunken din. 
I cannot well express the thoughts 
Which Peter in those noises found ; — 
A stifling power compressed his frame, 
While-as a swimming darkness came 
Over that duU and dreary sound. 
For well did Peter know the sound ; 
The language of those drunken joys 
To him, a jovial soul, I ween, 
But a few hours ago, had been 
A gladsome and a welcome noise. 
Now, turned adrift into the past, 
He finds no solace in his course ; 
Like planet-strieken men of yore, 
He trembles, smitten to the core 
By strong compunction and remorse. 
But, more than all, his heart is stung 
To think of one, almost a child ; 
A sweet and playful Highland girl, 
As light and beauteous as a squirrel, 
As beauteous and as wild ! 

Her dwelling was a lonely house, 
A cottage in a heathy dell ; 
And she put on her gown of green, 
And left her mother at sixteen, 
And followed Peter Bell. 
But many good and pious thoughts 
Had she ; and, in the kirk to pray, 
Two long Scotch miles, through rain or snow, 
To kirk she had been used to go, 
Twice every Sabbath-day. 
And, when she followed Peter Bell, 
It was to lead an honest life ; 
For he, with tongue not used to falter, 
Had pledged his troth before the altar 
To love her as Ms wedded wife. 
A mother's hope is hers ; — but soon 
She drooped and pined like one forlorn ; 
From Scripture she a name did borrow ; 
Benoni, or the child of sorrow, 
She called her babe unborn. 
For she had learned how Peter lived, 
And took it in most grievous part ; 
She to the very bone was worn, 
And, ere that httle child was born, 
Died of a broken heart. 
And now the Spirits of the Mind 
Are busy with poor Peter Bell ; 
Upon the rights of visual sense 
Usurping, with a prevalence 
More terrible than magic spell. 
Close by a brake of flowering furze 
(Above it shivering aspens play) 
He sees an unsubstantial creature, 
His very self in form and feature, 
Not four yards from the broad highway : 
And stretched beneath the furze he sees 
The Highland girl — it is no other ; 
And hears her crying as she cried, 
The very moment that she died, 
" My mother ! oh my mother !" 
The sweat pours down from Peter's face, 
So grievous is his heart's contrition ; 
With agony his eye-balls ache 
While he beholds by the furze-brake 
This miserable vision ! 


PETER BELL. 

 

Jalm is the well-deserving brute, 
His peace hath no offence betrayed ; 
ut now, while down that slope he wends, 
\ voice to Peter's ear ascends, 
Resounding from the woody glade : 
The voice, though clamorous as a horn 
Re-echoed by a naked rock, 
!!omes from that tabernacle — List ! 
iiVithin, a fervent Methodist 
s preaching to no heedless flock ! 
: Repent ! repent !" he cries aloud, 
: While yet ye may find mercy ; — strive 
Co love the Lord with all your might ; 
["urn to him, seek him day and night, 
ind save your souls alive ! 
Repent ! repent ! though ye have gone, 
?hrough paths of wickedness and woe, 
Lfter the Babylonian harlot ; 
llnd, though your sins be red as scarlet, 
'hey shall be white as snow !" 
: lvea as he passed the door, these words 
)id plainly come to Peter's ears ; 
Lnd they such joyful tidings were, 
"he joy was more than he could bear ! — 
le melted into tears. 
Iweet tears of hope and tenderness ! 
ind fast they fell, a plenteous shower ! 
iis nerves, his sinews seemed to melt ; 
through all his iron frame was felt 
i gentle, a relaxing, power ! 
'ach fibre of his frame was weak ; 
Veak all the animal within ; 
)iut, in its helplessness, grew mild 
md gentle as an infant child, 
In infant that has known no sin. 
Tis said, meek Beast ! that, through Heaven's grace, 
le not iinmoved did notice now 
'he cross upon thy shoulder scored, 
.'or lasting impress, by the Lord 
J'o whom all human-kind shall bow ; 
jlemorial of his touch— that day 
|VTien Jesus humbly deigned to ride, 
Entering the proud Jerusalem, 
!y an immeasurable stream 
f shouting people deified ! 

Meanwhile the persevering Ass, 
Turned towards a gate that hung in view 
Across a shady lane ; his chest 
Against the yielding gate he pressed 
And quietly passed through. 
And up the stony lane he goes ; 
No ghost more softly ever trod ; 
Among the stones and pebbles, he 
Sets down his hoofs inaudibly, 
As if with felt his hoofs were shod. 
Along the lane the trusty Ass 
Went twice two hundred yards or more, 
And no one could have guessed his aim, — 
Till to a lonely house he came, 
And stopped beside the door. 
Thought Peter, 'tis the poor man's home ! 
He listens — not a sound is heard 
Save from the trickling household rill ; 
But, stepping o'er the cottage-sill, 
Forthwith a little Girl appeared. 
She to the Meeting-house was bound 
In hopes some tidings there to gather : 
No glimpse it is, no doubtful gleam ; 
She saw — and uttered with a scream, 
"My father ! here's my father !" 
The very word was plainly heard, 
Heard plainly by the wretched Mother — 
Her joy was like a deep affright: 
And forth she rushed into the light, 
And saw it was another ! 
And, instantly, upon the earth, 
Beneath the full moon shining bright, 
Close to the Ass's feet she fell; 
At the same moment Peter Bell 
Dismounts in most unhappy plight. 
As he beheld the Woman lie 
Breathless and motionless, the mind 
Of Peter sadly was confused ; 
But, though to such demands unused, 
And helpless almost as the blind, 
He raised her up ; and, while he held 
Her body propped against his knee, 
The Woman waked — and when she spied 
The poor Ass standing by her side, 
She moaned most bitterly.

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

" Oh ! God be praised — my heart 's at ease — 
For he is dead — I know it well ! " 
— At this she wept a bitter flood ; 
And, in the best way that he could, 
His tale did Peter tell. 
He trembles — he is pale as death ; 
His voice is weak with perturbation ; 
He turns aside his head, he pauses ; 
Poor Peter from a thousand causes, 
Is crippled sore in his narration. 
At length she learned how he espied 
The Ass in that small meadow-ground ; 
And that her Husband now lay dead, 
Beside that luckless river's bed 
In which he had been drowned. 
A piercing look the Widow cast 
Upon the Beast that near her stands ; 
She sees 'tis he, that 'tis the same ; 
She calls the poor Ass by his name, 
And wrings, and wrings her hands. 
" wretched loss — untimely stroke ! 
If he had died upon his bed ! 
He knew not one forewarning pain ; 
He never will come home again — 
Is dead, for ever dead ! " 
Beside the Woman Peter stands ; 
His heart is opening more and more ; 
A holy sense pervades his mind ; 
He feels what he for human kind 
Had never felt before. 
At length, by Peter's arm sustained, 
The Woman rises from the ground — 
" Oh, mercy ! something must be done, 
My little Rachel, you must run, — 
Some willing neighbour must be found. 
Make haste— my little Rachel — do, 
The first you meet with — bid him come, 
Ask him to lend his horse to-night, 
And this good Man, whom Heaven requite, 
Will help to bring the body home." 
Away goes Rachel weeping loud ; — 
An Infant, waked by her distress, 
Makes in the house a piteous cry; 
And Peter hears the Mother sigh, 
" Seven are they, and all fatherless ! " 

And now is Peter taught to feel 
That man's heart is a holy thing ; 
And Nature, through a world of death, 
Breathes into him a second breath, 
More searching than the breath of spring. 
Upon a stone the Woman sits 
In agony of silent grief — 
From his own thoughts did Peter start ; 
He longs to press her to his heart, 
From love that cannot find relief. 
But roused, as if through every limb 
Had past a sudden shock of dread, 
The Mother o'er the threshold flies, 
And up the cottage stairs she hies, 
And on the pillow lays her burning head. 
And Peter turns his steps aside 
Into a shade of darksome trees, 
Where he sits down, he knows not how, 
With his hands pressed against his brow, 
His elbows on his tremulous knees. 
There, self-involved, does Peter sit 
Until no sign of life he makes, 
As if his mind were sinking deep 
Through years that have been long asleep ! 
The trance is passed away — he wakes ; 
He lifts his head — and sees the Ass 
Yet standing in the clear moonshine ; 
"When shall I be as good as thou? 
Oh ! would, poor beast, that I had now 
A heart but half as good as thine ! " 
But He — who deviously hath sought 
His Father through the lonesome woods, . 
Hath sought, proclaiming to the ear 
Of night his grief and sorrowful fear — 
He comes, escaped from fields and floods ; — 
With weary pace is drawing nigh ; 
He sees the Ass — and nothing living 
Had ever such a fit of joy 
As hath this little orphan Boy, 
For he has no misgiving ! 
Forth to the gentle Ass he springs, 
And up about his neck he climbs ; 
In loving words he talks to him, 
He kisses, kisses face and limb, — 
He kisses him a thousand times ! 

MISCELLANEOUS SONNETS. 

 

This Peter sees, while in the shade 
He stood beside the cottage-door ; 
And Peter Bell, the ruffian wild, 
Sobs loud, he sobs even like a child, 
"Oh ! God, I can endure no more ! " 
— Here ends my. Tale : for in a trice 
Arrived a neighbour with his horse ; 
Peter went forth with him straightway ; 
And, with due care, ere break of day, 
Together they brought back the Corse. 

And many years did this poor Ass, 
Whom once it was my luck to see 
Cropping the shrubs of Leming-Lane, 
Help by his labour to maintain 
The Widow and her family. 
And Peter Bell, who, till that night, 
Had been the wildest of his clan, 
Forsook his crimes, renounced his folly, 
And, after ten months' melancholy, 
Became a good and honest man.

DEDICATION. 


Happy the feeling from the bosom thrown 
 In perfect shape (whose beauty Time shall spare 
 Though a breath made it) like a bubble blown 
 For summer pastime into wanton air ; 
 Happy the thought best likened to a stone 
Of the sea-beach, when, polished with nice care, 
Veins it discovers exquisite and rare, 

Which for the loss of that moist gleam atone 
That tempted first to gather it. That here, 
O chief of Friends ! such feelingsl presenti 
To thy regard, with thoughts so fortunate, 
Were a vain notion ; but the hope is dear, 
That thou, if not with partial joy elate, 
Wilt smile upon this gift with more than mild content ! 

PART I. 

Nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room ; 
And hermits are contented with their cells ; 
And students with their pensive citadels ; 
i Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom, 
' Sit blithe and happy ; bees that soar for bloom, 
: High as the highest Peak of Furness-fells, 
Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells : 
In truth the prison, unto which we doom 
Ourselves, no prison is : and hence for me, 
, In sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound 
! Within the Sonnet's scanty plot of ground ; 
Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must 
be) 
Who have felt the weight of too much liberty, 
Should find brief solace there, as I have found. 

ADMONITION. 
Intended more particularly for the perusal of those who may have 
happened to he enamoured of some heautiful Place of Retreat, in 
the Country of the Lakes. 
Well may'st thou halt — and gaze with brightening 
eye! 
The lovely Cottage in the guardian nook 
Hath stirred thee deeply ; with its own dear brook, 
Its own small pasture, almost its own sky ! 
But covet not the Abode ; — forbear to sigh, 
As many do, repining while they look ; 
Intruders — who would tear from Nature's book 
This precious leaf, with harsh impiety. 
Think what the Home must be if it were thine, 
Even thine, though few thy wants ! — Roof, window, 
door, 
The very flowers are sacred to the Poor, 
The roses to the porch which they entwine : 
Yea, all, that now enchants thee, from the day 
On which it should be touched, would melt away. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

" Beloved Vale !" I said, " when I shall con 
Those many records of my childish years, 
Remembrance of myself and of my peers 
Will press me down : to think of what is gone 
Will be an awful thought, if life have one." 
But, when into the Vale I came, no fears 
Distressed me ; from mine eyes escaped no tears ; 
Deep thought, or dread remembrance, had I none. 
By doubts and thousand petty fancies crost 
I stood, of simple shame the blushing Thrall ; 
So narrow seemed the brooks, the fields so small ! 
A Juggler's balls old Time about him tossed ; 
I looked, I stared, I smiled, I laughed ; and all 
The weight of sadness was in wonder lost. 


AT APPLETHWAITE, NEAR KESWICK. 
. 
Beaumont ! it was thy wish that I should rear 
A seemly Cottage in tins sunny Dell, 
On favoured ground, thy gift, where I might dwell 
In neighbourhood with One to me most dear, 
That undivided we from year to year 
Might work in our high Calling — a bright hope 
To which our fancies, mingling, gave free scope 
Till checked by some necessities severe. 
And should these slacken, honoured Beaumont ! 
still 
Even then we may perhaps in vain implore 
Leave of our fate thy wishes to fulfil. 
Whether this boon be granted us or not, 
Old Skiddaw will look down upon the Spot 
With pride, the Muses love it evermore. 

Pelion and Ossa flourish side by side, 
Together in immortal books enrolled : 
His ancient dower Olympus hath not sold ; 
And that inspiring Hill, which ' did divide 
Into two ample horns his forehead wide,' 
Shines with poetic radiance as of old ; 
While not an English Mountain we behold 
By the celestial Muses glorified. 
Yet round our sea-girt shore they rise in crowds : 
What was the great Parnassus' self to Thee, 
Mount Skiddaw ? In his natural sovereignty 
Our British Hill is nobler far ; he shrouds 
His double front among Atlantic clouds, 
And pours forth streams more sweet than Castaly. 

There is a little unpretending Rill 
Of limpid water, humbler far than aught 
That ever among Men or Naiads sought 
Notice or name ! — It quivers down the hill, 
Furrowing its shallow way with dubious will ; 
Yet to my mind this scanty Stream is brought 
Oftener than Ganges or the Nile ; a thought 
Of private recollection sweet and still ! 
Months perish with their moons ; year treads on 
year; 
But, faithful Emma ! thou with me canst say 
That, while ten thousand pleasures disappear, 
And flies their memory fast almost as they ; 
The immortal Spirit of one happy day 
Lingers beside that Rill, in vision clear. 



Her only pilot the soft breeze, the boat 
Lingers, but Fancy is well satisfied ; 
With keen-eyed Hope, with Memory, at her side, 
And the glad Muse at liberty to note 
All that to each is precious, as we float 
Gently along ; regardless who shall chide 
If the heavens smile, and leave us free to glide, 
Happy Associates breathing air remote 
From trivial cares. But, Fancy and the Muse, 
Why have I crowded this small bark with you 
And others of your kind, ideal crew ! 
While here sits One whose brightness owes its hues 
To flesh and blood ; no Goddess from above, 
No fleeting Spirit, but my own true Love ? 

The fairest, brightest, hues of ether fade ; 
The sweetest notes must terminate and die ; 
O Friend ! thy flute has breathed a harmony 
Softly resounded through this rocky glade ; 
Such strains of rapture as the Genius played 
In his still haunt on Bagdad's summit high ; 
He who stood visible to Mirza's eye, 
Never before to human sight betrayed. 
Lo, in the vale, the mists of evening spread ! 
The visionary Arches are not there, 
Nor the green Islands, nor the sinning Seas ; 
Yet sacred is to me this Mountain's head, 
Whence I have risen, uplifted on the breeze 
Of harmony, above all earthly care. 

 See the Vision of Mirza in the Spectator. 

MISCELLANEOUS SONNETS. 

 

UPON THE SIGHT OF A BEAUTIFUL PICTURE, 
Painted by Sir G. H. Beaumont, Bart. 
i Praised be the Art whose subtle power could stay- 
Yon cloud, and fix it in that glorious shape ; 
Nor would permit the thin smoke to escape, 
Nor those bright sunbeams to forsake the day ; 
Which stopped that band of travellers on their way, 
 Ere they were lost within the shady wood ; 
( And showed the Bark upon the glassy flood 
' For ever anchored in her sheltering bay. 
Soul-soothing Art ! whom Morning, Noon-tide, 
Even, 
Do serve with all their changeful pageantry ; 
Thou, with ambition modest yet sublime, 
Here, for the sight of mortal man, hast given 
To one brief moment caught from fleeting time 
The appropriate calm of blest eternity. 

I" Why, Minstrel, these untuneful murmurings — 
Dull, flagging notes that with each other jar V 
" Think, gentle Lady, of a Harp so far 
From its own country, and forgive the strings." 
(A simple answer ! but even so forth springs, 
From the Castalian fountain of the heart, 
The Poetry of Life, and all that Art 
Divine of words quickening insensate things. 
From the submissive necks of guiltless men 
iStretched on the block, the glittering axe recoils ; 
,Sun, moon, and stars, all struggle in the toils 
Of mortal sympathy ; what wonder then 
That the poor Harp distempered music yields 
To its sad Lord, far from his native fields ? 

Aerial Rock — whose solitary brow 
From this low threshold daily meets my sight ; 
When I step forth to hail the morning light ; 
; Or quit the stars with a lingering farewell — how 
.Shall Fancy pay to thee a grateful vow ? 
How, with the Muse's aid, her love attest ? 
—By planting on thy naked head the crest 
Of an imperial Castle, which the plough 
Of main shall not touch. Innocent scheme ! 
I That doth presume no more than to supply 
A grace the sinuous vale and roaring stream 
'Want, through neglect of hoar Antiquity. 
|Rise, then, ye votive Towers ! and catch a gleam 
Df golden sunset, ere it fade and die. 

TO SLEEP. 
gentle Sleep ! do they belong to thee, 
These twinklings of oblivion ? Thou dost love 
To sit in meekness, like the brooding Dove, 
A captive never wishing to be free. 
This tiresome night, Sleep ! thou art to me 
A Fly, that up and down himself doth shove 
Upon a fretful rivulet, now above 
Now on the water vexed with mockery. 
 have no pain that calls for patience, no ; 
Hence am I cross and peevish as a child : 
Am pleased by fits to have thee for my foe, 
Yet ever willing to be reconciled : 
gentle Creature ! do not use me so, 
But once and deeply let me be beguiled. 

Fond words have oft been spoken to thee, Sleep ! 
And thou hast had thy store of tenderest names ; 
The very sweetest, Fancy culls or frames, 
When thankfulness of heart is strong and deep ! 
Dear Bosom-child we call thee, that dost steep 
In rich reward all suffering ; Balm that tames 
All anguish ; Saint that evil thoughts and aims 
Takest away, and into souls dost creep, 
Like to a breeze from heaven. Shall I alone, 
I surely not a man ungently made, 
CaU thee worst Tyrant by which Flesh is crost ? 
Perverse, self-willed to own and to disown, 
Mere slave of them who never for thee prayed, 
Still last to come where thou art wanted most ! 

TO SLEEP. 
A flock of sheep that leisurely pass by, 
One after one ; the sound of rain, and bees 
Murmuring ; the fall of rivers, winds and seas, 
Smooth fields, white sheets of water, and pure sky ; 
I have thought of all by turns, and yet do lie 
Sleepless ! and soon the small birds' melodies 
Mtfst hear, first uttered from my orchard trees ; 
And the first cuckoo's melancholy cry. 
Even thus last night, and two nights more, I lay, 
And could not win thee, Sleep ! by any stealth : 
So do not let me wear to-night away : 
Without Thee what is all the morning's wealth ? 
Come, blessed barrier between day and day, 
Dear mother of fresh thoughts and joyous health ! 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

THE WILD DUCK'S NEST. 
The imperial Consort of the Fairy-king 
Owns not a sylvan bower ; or gorgeous cell 
With emerald floored, and with purpureal shell 
Ceilinged and roofed ; that is so fan a thing 
As this low structure, for the tasks of Spring, 
Prepared by one who loves the buoyant swell 
Of the brisk waves, yet here consents to dwell ; 
And spreads in steadfast peace her brooding wing. 
Words cannot paint the o'ershadowing yew-tree 
And dimly-gleaming Nest, — ahollow crown [bough, 
Of golden leaves inlaid with silver down, 
Fine as the mother's softest plumes allow : 
I gazed — and, self-accused while gazing, sighed 
For human-kind, weak slaves of cumbrous pride ! 

WRITTEN UPON A BLANK LEAF IN " THE COMPLETE 
ANGLER." 
While flowing rivers yield a blameless sport, 
Shall live the name of Walton : Sage benign ! 
Whose pen, the mysteries of the rod and line 
Unfolding, did not fruitlessly exhort 
To reverend watching of each still report 
That Nature utters from her rural shrine. 
Meek, nobly versed in simple discipline — 
He found the longest summer day too short, 
To his loved pastime given by sedgy Lee, 
Or down the tempting maze of Shawford brook — 
Fairer than life itself, in this sweet Book, 
The cowslip-bank and shady willow-tree ; 
And the fresh meads — where flowed, from every 
Of his full bosom, gladsome Piety ! [nook 

TO THE POET, JOHN DYER. 
Bard of the Fleece, whose skilful genius made 
That work a living landscape fair and bright ; 
Nor hallowed less with musical delight 
Than those soft scenes through which thy child- 
hood strayed, 
Those southern tracts of Cambria, ' deep embayed, 
With green hills fenced, with ocean's murmur lull'd;' 
Though hasty Fame hath many a chaplet culled 
For worthless brows, while in the pensive shade 
Of cold neglect she leaves thy head ungraced, 
Yet pure and powerful minds, hearts meek and still, 
A grateful few, shall love thy modest Lay, 
Long as the shepherd's bleating flock shall stray 
O'er naked Snowdon's wide aerial waste ; 
Long as the thrush shall pipe on Grongar Hill ! 

ON THE DETRACTION WHICH FOLLOWED THE PUBLI- 
CATION OF A CERTAIN POEM. 

A Book came forth of late, called Peter Bell ; 
Not negligent the style ; — the matter ? — good 
As aught that song records of Robin Hood ; 
Or Roy, renowned through many a Scottish dell ; 
But some (who brook those hackneyed themes 
full well, 
Nor heat, at Tarn o' Shanter's name, their blood) 
Waxed wroth, and with foul claws,, a harpy brood, 
On Bard and Hero clamorously fell. 
Heed not, wild Rover once through heath and glen, 
Who mad'st at length the better life thy choice, 
Heed not such onset ! nay, if praise of men 
To thee appear not an unmeaning voice, 
Lift up that grey-haired forehead, and rejoice 
In the just tribute of thy Poet's pen ! 

Grief, thou hast lost an ever ready friend 
Now that the cottage Spinning-wheel is mute ; 
And Care — a comforter that best could suit 
Her froward mood, and softliest reprehend ; 
And Love — a charmer's voice, that used to lend, 
More efficaciously than aught that flows 
From harp or lute, kind influence to compose 
The throbbing pulse — else troubled without end : 
Even Joy could tell, Joy craving truce and rest 
From her own overflow, what power sedate 
On those revolving motions did await 
Assiduously — to soothe her aching breast ; 
And, to a point of just relief, abate 
The mantling triumphs of a day too blest. 


to s. H. 
Excuse is needless when with love sincere 
Of occupation, not by fashion led, [spread ; 
Thou turn'st the Wheel that slept with dust o'er- 
My nerves from no such murmur shrink, — tho' near, 
Soft as the Dorhawk's to a distant ear, 
When twilight shades darken the mountain's head. 
Even She who toils to spin our vital thread 
Might smile on work, Lady, once so dear 
To household virtues. Venerable Art, 
Torn from the Poor ! yet shall kind Heaven protect 
Its own ; though Rulers, with undue respect, 
Trusting to crowded factory and mart 
And proud discoveries of the intellect, 
Heed not the pillage of man's ancient heart. 

MISCELLANEOUS SONNETS. 

 

IMPOSED IN ONE OF THE VA'LLEYS OF WESTMORE- 
LAND, ON EASTER SUNDAY. 
With each recurrence of this glorious morn 
That saw the Saviour in his human frame 
ftise from the dead, erewhile the Cottage-dame 
?ut on fresh raiment — till that hour unworn : 
(Domestic hands the home-bred wool had shorn, 
Ind she who span it culled the daintiest fleece, 
In thoughtful reverence to the Prince of Peace, 
jiVhose temples bled beneath the platted thorn. 
ji. blest estate when piety sublime 
These humble props disdained not ! green dales ! 
ad may I be who heard your sabbath chime 
When Art's abused inventions were unknown ; 
iind Nature's various wealth was all your own ; 
i.nd benefits were weighed in Reason's scales ! 

DECAY OF PIETY. 
I)ft have I seen, ere Time had ploughed my cheek, 
Matrons and Sires — who, punctual to the call 
|)f their loved Church, on fast or festival 
Through the long year the House of Prayer would 
y Christmas snows, by visitation bleak [seek : 
; ')f Easter winds, unscared, from hut or hall 
They came to lowly bench or sculptured stall, 
,ut with one fervour of devotion meek. 
! see the places where they once were known, 
ind ask, surrounded even by kneeling crowds, 
Is ancient Piety for ever flown ? 
'Uas ! even then they seemed like fleecy clouds 
Chat, struggling through the western sky, have won 
Their pensive light from a departed sun ! 

(COMPOSED ON THE EVE OF THE MARRIAGE OF A 
FRIEND IN THE VALE OF GRASMERE, . 
JiVhat need of clamorous bells, or ribands gay, 
These humble nuptials to proclaim or grace ? 
Angels of love, look down upon the place ; 
Shed on the chosen vale a sun-bright day ! 
fet no proud gladness would the Bride display 
iven for such promise : — serious is her face, 
Modest her mien ; and she, whose thoughts keep pace 
With gentleness, in that becoming way 
Fill thank you. Faultless does the Maid appear ; 
Ko disproportion in her soul, no strife : 
,ut, when the closer view of wedded life 
Hath shown that nothing human can be clear 
!From frailty, for that insight may the Wife 
j r ° her indulgent Lord become more dear. 

XXIV. 
FROM THE ITALIAN OF MICHAEL ANGELO. 
I. 
Yes ! hope may with my strong desire keep pace, 
And I be undeluded, unbetrayed ; 
For if of our affections none finds grace 
In sight of Heaven, then, wherefore hath God made 
The world which we inhabit ? Better plea 
Love cannot have, than that in loving thee 
Glory to that eternal Peace is paid, 
Who such divinity to thee imparts 
As hallows and makes pure all gentle hearts. 
His hope is treacherous only whose love dies 
With beauty, which is varying every hour ; 
But, in chaste hearts uninfluenced by the power 
Of outward change, there blooms a deathless flower, 
That breathes on earth the air of paradise. 
xxv. 
FROM THE SAME. 
II. 
No mortal object did these eyes behold 
When first they met the placid light of thine, 
And my Soul felt her destiny divine, 
And hope of endless peace in me grew bold : 
Heaven-born, the Soul a heaven-ward course must 
Beyond the visible world she soars to seek [hold ; 
(For what delights the sense is false and weak) 
Ideal Form, the universal mould. 
The wise man, I affirm, can find no rest 
In that which perishes : nor will he lend 
His heart to aught which doth on time depend. 
'Tis sense, unbridled will, and not true love, 
That kills the soul : love betters what is best, 
Even here below, but more in heaven above. 

FROM THE SAME. TO THE SUPREME BEING. 
in. 
The prayers I make will then be sweet indeed 
If Thou the spirit give by which I pray : 
My unassisted heart is barren clay, 
That of its native self can nothing feed : 
Of good and pious works thou art the seed, 
That quickens only where thou say'st it may : 
Unless Thou shew to us thine own true way 
No man can find it : Father ! Thou must lead. 
Do Thou, then, breathe those thoughts into my mind 
By which such virtue may in me be bred 
That in thy holy footsteps I may tread ; 
The fetters of my tongue do Thou unbind, 
That I may have the power to sing of thee, 
And sound thy praises everlastingly. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

Surprised by joy — impatient as the Wind 
I turned to share the transport — Oh ! with whom 
But Thee, deep buried in the silent tomb, 
That spot which no vicissitude can find ? 
Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind- 
But how could I forget thee ? Through what power, 
Even for the least division of an hour, 
Have I been so beguiled as to be blind 
To my most grievous loss ? — That thought's return 
Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore, 
Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn, 
Knowing my heart's best treasure was no more ; 
That neither present time, nor years unborn 
Could to my sight that heavenly face restore. 

Methought I saw the footsteps of a throne 
Which mists and vapours from mine eyes did 
shroud — 
Nor view of who might sit thereon allowed ; 
But all the steps and ground about were strown 
With sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone 
Ever put on ; a miserable crowd, 
Sick, hale, old, young, who cried before that cloud, 
" Thou art our king, Death ! to thee we groan." 
Those steps I clomb ; the mists before me gave 
Smooth way ; and I beheld the face of one 
Sleeping alone within a mossy cave, 
With her face up to heaven ; that seemed to have 
Pleasing remembrance of a thought foregone ; 
A lovely Beauty in a summer grave ! 

NOVEMBER, . 
ii. 
Even so for me a Vision sanctified 
The sway of Death ; long ere mine eyes had seen 
Thy countenance — the still rapture of thy mien — 
When thou, dear Sister ! wert become Death's 
No trace of pain or languor could abide [Bride : 
That change : — age on thy brow was smoothed — 
thy cold 
Wan cheek at once was privileged to unfold 
A loveliness to living youth denied. 
Oh ! if within me hope should e'er dec'ine, 
The lamp of faith, lost Friend ! too faintly burn ; 
Then may that heaven-revealing smile of thine, 
The bright assurance, visibly return : 
And let my spirit in that power divine 
Rejoice, as, through that power, it ceased to mourn. 



It is a beauteous evening, calm and free, 
The holy time is quiet as a Nun 
Breathless with adoration ; the broad sun 
Is sinking down in its tranquillity ; 
The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea : 
Listen ! the mighty Being is awake, 
And doth with his eternal motion make 
A sound like thunder — everlastingly. 
Dear Child ! dear Girl ! that walkest with me 
here, 
If thou appear untouched by solemn thought, 
Thy nature is not therefore less divine : 
Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year ; 
And worship' st at the Temple's inner shrine, 
God being with thee when we know it not 



Where lies the Land to which yon Ship must go ! 
Fresh as a lark mounting at break of day, 
Festively she puts forth in trim array ; 
Is she for tropic suns, or polar snow ? 
What boots the inquiry ? — Neither friend nor foe 
She cares for ; let her travel where she may, 
She finds familiar names, a beaten way 
Ever before her, and a wind to blow. 
Yet still I ask, what haven is her mark ? 
And, almost as it was when ships were rare, 
(From time to time, like Pilgrims, here and there 
Crossing the waters) doubt, and something dark, 
Of the old Sea some reverential fear, 
Is with me at thy farewell, joyous Bark ! 

XXX,, 
With Ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh, 
Like stars in heaven, and joyously it showed; 
Some lying fast at anchor in the road, 
Some veering up and down, one knew not why. 
A goodly Vessel did I then espy 
Come like a giant from a haven broad ; 
And lustily along the bay she strode, 
Her ta,ckling rich, and of apparel high. 
This Ship was nought to me, nor I to her, 
Yet I pursued her with a Lover's look ; 
This Ship to all the rest did I prefer : 
When will she turn, and whither ? She will 
No tarrying ; where She comes the winds mu-t 
stir: 
On went She, and due north her journey took. 

MISCELLANEOUS SONNETS. 

 

he world is too much with us ; late and soon, 
etting and spending, we lay waste our powers : 
ittle we see in Nature that is ours ; 
e have given our hearts away, a sordid boon ! 
Ills Sea that bares her bosom to the moon ; 
lie winds that will be howling at all hours, 
nd are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers ; 
for this, for every thing, we are out of tune ; 
 moves us not. — Great God ! I 'd rather be 
Pagan suckled in a creed outworn ; 
) might I, standing on this pleasant lea, 
ave glimpses that would make me less forlorn ; 
ave sight of Proteus rising from the sea ;

£ nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye ; 
.mvinced that there, there only, she can lay

part she toils within the chosen ring ; 
 liile the stars shine, or while day's purple eye 
j gently closing with the flowers of spring ; 
here even the motion of an Angel's wing 
i : ould interrupt the intense tranquillity 
' silent hills, and more than silent sky.

TO THE MEMORY OF RAISLEY CALVERT. 
Calvert ! it must not be unheard by them 
Who may respect my name, that I to thee 
Owed many years of early liberty. 
This care was thine when sickness did condemn 
Thy youth to hopeless wasting, root and stem — 
That I, if frugal and severe, might stray 
Where'er I liked ; and finally array 
My temples with the Muse's diadem. 
Hence, if in freedom I have loved the truth ; 
If there be aught of pure, or good, or great, 
In my past verse ; or shall be, in the lays 
Of higher mood, which now I meditate ; — 
It gladdens me, worthy, short-lived, Youth ! 
To think how much of this will be thy praise. 

PART II. 
r. 
Scorn not the Sonnet ; Critic, you have frowned, 
Mindless of its just honours ; with this key 
Shakspeare unlocked his heart ; the melody 
Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound ; 
A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound ; 
With it Camoens soothed an exile's grief ; 
The Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf 
Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned 
His visionary brow : a glow-worm lamp, 
It cheered mild Spenser, called from Faery-land 
To struggle through dark ways ; and, when a damp 
Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand 
The Thing became a trumpet ; whence he blew 
Soul-animating strains — alas, too few ! 

How sweet it is, when mother Fancy rocks 
The wayward brain, to saunter through a wood ! 
An old place, full of many a lovely brood, 
Tall trees, green arbours, and ground-flowers in 
flocks ; 
And wild rose tip-toe upon hawthorn stocks, 
Like a bold Girl, who plays her agile pranks 
AtWakes and Fairs with wandering Mountebanks, — 
When she stands cresting the Clown's head, and 
The crowd beneath her. Verily I think, [mocks 
Such place to me is sometimes like a dream 
Or map of the whole world : thoughts, link by link, 
Enter through ears and eyesight, with such gleam 
Of all things, that at last in fear I shrink, 
And leap at once from the delicious stream. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

TO B. R. HAYDON. 
High is our calling, Friend ! — Creative Art 
(Whether the instrument of words she use, 
Or pencil pregnant with ethereal hues,) 
Demands the service of a mind and heart, 
Though sensitive, yet, in their weakest part, 
Heroically fashioned to infuse 
Faith in the whispers of the lonely Muse, 
While the whole world seems adverse to desert. 
And, oh ! when Nature sinks, as oft she may, 
Through long-lived pressure of obscure distress, 
Still to be strenuous for the bright reward, 
And in the soul admit of no decay, 
Brook no continuance of weak-mindedness — 
Great is the glory, for the strife is hard ! 

From the dark chambers of dejection freed, 
Spurning the unprofitable yoke of care, 
Rise, Gillies, rise : the gales of youth shall bear 
Thy genius forward like a winged steed. 
Though bold Bellerophon (so Jove decreed 
In wrath) fell headlong from the fields of air, 
Yet a rich guerdon waits on minds that dare, 
If aught be in them of immortal seed, 
And reason govern that audacious flight 
Which heaven-ward they direct. — Then droop not 
thou, 
Erroneously renewing a sad vow 
In the low dell 'mid Roslin's faded grove : 
A cheerful life is what the Muses love, 
A soai'ing spirit is their prime delight. 

Fair Prime of life ! were it enough to gild 
With ready sunbeams every straggling shower ; 
And, if an unexpected cloud should lower, 
Swiftly thereon a rainbow arch to build 
For Fancy's errands,— then, from fields half-tilled 
Gathering green weeds to mix with poppy flower, 
Thee might thy Minions crown, and chant thy 
power, 
Unpitied by the wise, all censure stilled. 
Ah ! show that worthier honours are thy due ; 
Fair Prime of life ! arouse the deeper heart ; 
Confirm the Spirit glorying to pursue 
Some path of steep ascent and lofty aim ; 
And, if there be a joy that slights the claim 
Of grateful memory, bid that joy depart. 

I watch, and long have watched, with calm reTet 
Yon slowly-sinking star — immortal Sire 
(So might he seem) of all the glittering quire ! 
Blue ether still surrounds him — yet— and yet ; 
But now the horizon's rocky parapet 
Is reached, where, forfeiting his bright attire, 
He burns — transmuted to a dusky fire — 
Then pays submissively the appointed debt 
To the flying moments, and is seen no more. 
Angels and gods ! We struggle with our fate, 
While health, power, glory, from their height 
decline, 
Depressed ; and then extinguished : and our state. 
In this, how different, lost Star, from thine, 
That no to-morrow shall our beams restore ! 

I heard (alas ! 't was only in a dream) 
Strains — which, as sage Antiquity believed, 
By waking ears have sometimes been received 
Wafted adown the wind from lake or stream ; 
A most melodious requiem, a supreme 
And perfect harmony of notes, achieved 
By a fair Swan on drowsy billows heaved, 
O'er which her pinions shed a silver gleam. 
For is she not the votary of Apollo  
And knows she not, singing as he inspires, 
That bliss awaits her which the ungenial Hollow 
Of the dull earth partakes not, nor desires ? 
Mount, tuneful Bird, and join the immortal quires !| 
She soared — and I awoke, struggling in vain tcl 
follow. 

RETIREMENT. 
If the whole weight of what we think and feel, 
Save only far as thought and feeling blend 
With action, were as nothing, patriot Friend ! 
From thy remonstrance would be no appeal ; 
But to promote and fortify the weal 
Of our own Being is her paramount end ; 
A truth which they alone shall comprehend 
Who shun the mischief which they cannot i.'cal. 
Peace in these feverish times is sovereign bliss: 
Here, with no thirst but what the stream can Blake 
And startled only by the rustling brake, 
Cool air I breathe ; while the unincumbered Mind 
By some weak aims at services assigned 
To gentle Natures, thanks not Heaven amiss. 

 See the Phsedon of Plato, by which this Sonnet w.i I 
suggested.

[POSED AFTER A JOURNEY ACROSS THE HAMBLETON 
HILLS, YORKSHIRE. 
RK and more dark the shades of evening fell ; 
Be wished-for point was reached— but at an hour 
lien little could be gained from that rich dower 
 prospect, whereof many thousands tell. 
t did the glowing west with marvellous power 
lute us ; there stood Indian citadel, 
'.oaple of Greece, and minster with its tower 
istantially expressed — a place for bell 
I clock to toU from ! Many a tempting isle, 
;-th groves that never were imagined, lay 
jid seas how steadfast ! objects all for the eye 
 silent rapture ; but we felt the while 
p should forget them ; they are of the sky, 
id from our earthly memory fade away. 

 they are of the sky, 

And from our earthly memory fade away.' 
Those words were uttered as in pensive mood 
We turned, departing from that solemn sight : 
A contrast and reproach to gross delight, 
And life's unspiritual pleasures daily wooed ! 
But now upon this thought I cannot brood ; 
It is unstable as a dream of night ; 
Nor will I praise a cloud, however bright, 
Disparaging Man's gifts, and proper food. 
Grove, isle, with every shape of sky-built dome, 
Though clad in colours beautiful and pure, 
Find in the heart of man no natural home : 
The immortal Mind craves objects that endure : 
These cleave to it ; from these it cannot roam, 
Nor they from it : their fellowship is secure. 

SEPTEMBER,  J . 
While not a leaf seems faded ; while the fields, 
With ripening harvest prodigally fair, 
In brightest sunshine bask ; this nipping air, 
Sent from some distant clime where Winter wields 
His icy scimitar, a foretaste yields 
Of bitter change, and bids the flowers beware ; 
And whispers to the silent birds, " Prepare 
Against the threatening foe your trustiest shields." 
For me, who under kindlier laws belong 
To Nature's tuneful quire, this rustling dry 
Through leaves yet green, and yon crystalline sky, 
Announce a season potent to renew, 
Mid frost and snow, the instinctive joys of song, 
And nobler cares than listless summer knew. 

NOVEMBER . 
How clear, how keen, how marvellously bright 
The effluence from yon distant mountain's head, 
Which, strewn with snow smooth as the sky can 
shed, 
Shines like another sun — on mortal sight 
Uprisen, as if to check approaching Night, 
And all her twinkling stars. Who now would tread, 
If so he might, yon mountain's glittering head — 
Terrestrial, but a surface, by the flight 
Of sad mortality's earth-sullying wing, 
Unswept, unstained ? Nor shall the aerial Powers 
Dissolve that beauty, destined to endure, 
White, radiant, spotless, exquisitely pure, 
Through all vicissitudes, till genial Spring 
Has filled the laughing vales with welcome flowers. 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

COMPOSED DURING A STORM. 
One who was suffering tumult in his soul 
Yet failed to seek the sure relief of prayer, 
Went forth — his course surrendering to the care 
Of the fierce wind, while mid-day lightnings prowl 
Insidiously, untimely thunders growl ; 
While trees, dim-seen, in frenzied numhers, tear 
The lingering remnant of their yellow hair, 
And shivering wolves, surprised with darkness, howl 
As if the sun were not. He raised his eye 
Soul-smitten ; for, that instant, did appear 
Large space (mid dreadful clouds) of purest sky, 
An azure disc — shield of Tranquillity ; % 
Invisible, unlooked-for, minister 
Of providential goodness ever nigh ! 

TO A SNOW-DROP. 
Lone Flower, hemmed in with snows and white as 
But hardier far, once more I see thee bend [they 
Thy forehead, as if fearful to offend, 
Like an unhidden guest. Though day by day, 
Storms, sallying from the mountain-tops, way-lay 
The rising sun, and on the plains descend ; 
Yet art thou welcome, welcome as a friend 
Whose zeal outruns his promise ! Blue-eyed May 
Shall soon behold this border thickly set 
With bright jonquils, their odours lavishing 
On the soft west-wind and his frolic peers ; 
Nor will I then thy modest grace forget, 
Chaste Snow-drop, venturous harbinger of Spring, 
And pensive monitor of fleeting years ! 

TO THE LADY MARY LOWTHER. 
W ith a selection from the Poems of Anne, Countess of Winchilsea; 
and extracts of similar character from other Writers ; transcribed 
by a female friend. 
Lady ! I rifled a Parnassian Cave 
(But seldom trod) of mildly-gleaming ore ; 
And culled, from sundry beds, a lucid store 
Of genuine crystals, pure as those that pave 
The azure brooks, where Dian joys to lave 
Her spotless limbs ; and ventured to explore 
Dim shades — for reliques, upon Lethe's shore, 
Cast up at random by the sullen wave. 
To female hands the treasures were resigned ; 
And lo this Work !- — a grotto bright and clear 
From stain or taint ; in which thy blameless mind 
May feed on thoughts though pensive not austere ; 
Or, if thy deeper spirit be inclined 
To holy musing, it may enter here. 


TO LADY BEAUMONT. 
Lady ! the songs of Spring were in the grove 
While I was shaping beds for winter flowers ; 
While I was planting green unfading bowci s, 
And shrubs — to hang upon the warm alcove, 
And sheltering wall ; and still, as Fancy wove 
The dream, to time and nature's blended powen 
I gave this paradise for winter hours, 
A labyrinth, Lady ! which your feet shall rove. 
Yes ! when the sun of life more feebly shines, 
Becoming thoughts, I trust, of solemn gloom 
Or of high gladness you shall hither bring ; 
And these perennial bowers and inurmurijig jiint 
Be gracious as the music and the bloom 
And all the mighty ravishment of spring. 

There zs a pleasure in poetic pains 
Wliich only Poets know; — 't was rightly said ; 
Whom could the Muses else allure to tread 
Their smoothest paths, to wear their lightest ciiai:  
When happiest Fancy has inspired the strains, 
How oft the malice of one luckless word 
Pursues the Enthusiast to the social board, 
Haunts him belated on the silent plains ! 
Yet he repines not, if his thought stand clear, 
At last, of hindrance and obscurity, 
Fresh as the star that crowns the brow of morn ; 
Bright, speckless, as a softly-moulded tear 
The moment it has left the virgin's eye, 
Or rain-drop lingering on the pointed thorn. 

The Shepherd, looking eastward, softly said, 
" Bright is thy veil, Moon, as thou art bright ! 
Forthwith, that little cloud, in ether spread 
And penetrated all with tender light, 
She cast away, and showed her fulgent head 
Uncovered ; dazzling the Beholder's sight 
As if to vindicate her beauty's right, 
Her beauty thoughtlessly disparaged. 
Meanwhile that veil, removed or thrown asUc. 
Went floating from her, darkening as it went ; 
And a huge mass, to bury or to hide, 
Approached this glory of the firmament ; 
Who meekly yields, and is obscured — content 
With one calm triumph of a modest pride.

lijiis did the waters gleam, the mountains lower, 
r .j the rude Briton, when, in wolf-skin vest" 
Ire roving wild, he laid him down to rest 
( the bare rock, or through a leafy bower 
Joked ere his eyes were closed. By him was seen 
  self-same Vision which we now behold, 
j thy meek bidding, shadowy Power! brought 
forth ; 
 se mighty barriers, and the gulf between ; 
j  flood, the stars, — a spectacle as old 
i'the beginning of the heavens and earth ! 

I th how sad steps, Moon, thou climb' st the sky,

Here art thou  Thou so often seen on high 
I aning among the clouds a Wood-nymph's race !

^ lich they would stifle, move at such a pace ! 
northern Wind, to call thee to the chase, 
t blow to-night his bugle horn. Had I 
% power of Merlin, Goddess ! this should be : 
I I all the stars, fast as the clouds were riven,

sen both for beauty and for majesty. 

Even as a dragon's eye that feels the stress 
Of a bedimming sleep, or as a lamp 
Suddenly glaring through sepulchral damp, 
So burns yon Taper 'mid a black recess 
Of mountains, silent, dreary, motionless : 
The lake below reflects it not ; the sky 
Muffled in clouds, affords no company 
To mitigate and cheer its lonehness. 
Yet, round the body of that joyless Thing 
Which sends so far its melancholy light, 
Perhaps are seated in domestic ring 
A gay society with faces bright, 
Conversing, reading, laughing ; — or they sing, 
While hearts and voices in the song unite. 

The stars are mansions built by Nature's hand, 
And, haply, there the spirits of the blest 
Dwell, clothed in radiance, their immortal vest ; 
Huge Ocean shows, within his yellow strand, 
A habitation marvellously planned, 
For life to occupy in love and rest ; 
All that we see — is dome, or vault, or nest, 
Or fortress, reared at Nature's sage command. 
Glad thought for every season ! but the Spring 
Gave it while cares were weighing on my heart, 
'Mid song of birds, and insects murmuring ; 
And while the youthful year's prolific art — 
Of bud, leaf, blade, and flower — was fashioning 
Abodes where self-disturbance hath no part. 

Desponding Father ! mark this altered bough, 
So beautiful of late, with sunshine warmed, 
Or moist with dews ; what more unsightly now, 
Its blossoms shrivelled, and its fruit, if formed, 
Invisible ? yet Spring her genial brow 
Knits not o'er that discolouring and decay 
As false to expectation. Nor fret thou 
At like unlovely process in the May 
Of human life : a Stripling's graces blow, 
Fade and are shed, that from their timely fall 
(Misdeem it not a cankerous change) may grow 
Rich mellow bearings, that for thanks shall call : 
In all men, sinful is it to be slow 
To hope — in Parents, sinful above all.

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

CAPTIVITY. — MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS. 
" As the cold aspect of a sunless way 
Strikes through the Traveller's frame with deadlier 
chill, 
Oft as appears a grove, or obvious hill, 
Glistening with unparticipated ray, 
Or shining slope where he must never stray ; 
So joys, remembered without wish or will, 
Sharpen the keenest edge of present ill, —  
On the crushed heart a heavier burthen lay. 
Just Heaven, contract the compass of my mind 
To fit proportion with my altered state ! 
Quench those felicities whose light I find 
Reflected in my bosom all too late ! — 
be my spirit, like my thraldom, strait ; 
And, like mine eyes that stream with sorrow, blind!" 

ST. CATHERINE OF LEDBURY. 
When human touch (as monkish books attest) 
Nor was applied nor could be, Ledbury bells 
Broke forth in concert flung adown the dells, 
And upward, high as Malvern's cloudy crest ; 
Sweet tones, and caught by a noble Lady blest 
To rapture ! Mabel listened at the side 
Of her loved mistress : soon the music died, 
And Catherine said, ^tVC E ct tt}) lUg YCSt. 
Warned in a dream, the Wanderer long had sought 
A home that by such miracle of sound 
Must be revealed : — she heard it now, or felt 
The deep, deep joy of a confiding thought ; 
And there, a saintly Anchoress, she dwelt 
Till she exchanged for heaven that happy ground. 

Though narrow be that old Man's cares, and near, 
The poor old Man is greater than he seems : 
For he hath waking empire, wide as dreams ; 
An ample sovereignty of eye and ear. 
Rich are his walks with supernatural cheer ; 
The region of his inner spirit teems 
With vital sounds and monitory gleams 
Of high astonishment and pleasing fear. 
He the seven birds hath seen, that never part, 
Seen the Seven Whistlers in their nightly rounds, 
And counted them : and oftentimes will start — 
For overhead are sweeping Gabriel's Hounds 
Doomed, with their impious Lord, the flying Hart 
To chase for ever, on aerial grounds ! 

Four fiery steeds impatient of the rein 
Whirled us o'er sunless ground beneath a sky 
As void of sunshine, when, from that wide plain, 
Clear tops of far-off mountains we descry, 
Like a Sierra of cerulean Spain, 
All light and lustre. Did no heart reply ? 
Yes, there was One ; — for One, asunder fly 
The thousand links of that ethereal chain ; 
And green vales open out, with grove and field, 
And the fair front of many a happy Home ; 
Such tempting spots as into vision come 
While Soldiers, weary of the arms they wield 
And sick at heart of strifeful Christendom, 
Gaze on the moon by parting clouds revealed. 

Brook ! whose society the Poet seeks, 
Intent his wasted spirits to renew ; 
And whom the curious Painter doth pursue 
Through rocky passes, among flowery creeks, 
And tracks thee dancing down thy water-breaks ; 
If wish were mine some type of thee to view, 
Thee, and not thee thyself, I would not do 
Like Grecian Artists, give thee human cheeks, 
Channels for tears ; no Naiad should'st thou be,- 
Have neither limbs, feet, feathers, joints nor hairs 
It seems the Eternal Soul is clothed in thee 
With purer robes than those of flesh and blood, 
And hath bestowed on thee a safer good ; 
Unwearied joy, and fife without its cares. 

COMPOSED ON THE BANKS OF A ROCKY STREAM. 
Dogmatic Teachers, of the snow-white fur! 
Ye wrangling Schoolmen, of the scarlet hood ! 
Who, with a keenness not to be withstood, 
Press the point home, or falter and demur, 
Checked in your course by many a teasing burr ; 
These natural council-seats your acrid blood 
Might cool ; — and, as the Genius of the flood 
Stoops willingly to animate and spur 
Each fighter function slumbering in the brain, 
Yon eddying balls of foam, these arrowy gleMBS 
That o'er the pavement of the surging streams 
Welter and flash, a synod might detain 
With subtle speculations, haply vain, 
But surely less so than your far-fetched themes !

iv through these caverns. 

Of the propitious hour, thou may'st perceive 
The local Deity, with oozy hair 
And mineral crown, beside his jagged urn, 
Recumbent : Him thou may'st behold, who hides 
His lineaments by day, yet there presides, 
Teaching the docile waters how to turn, 
Or (if need be) impediment to spurn, 
And force their passage to the salt-sea tides ! 

COMPOSED UPON WESTMINSTER BRIDGE, SEPT. , i. 
Earth has not any thing to show more fair : 
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by 
A sight so touching in its majesty : 
This City now doth, like a garment, wear 
The beauty of the morning ; silent, bare, 
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie 
Open unto the fields, and to the sky ; 
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air. 
Never did sun more beautifully steep 
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill ; 
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep ! 
The river glideth at his own sweet will : 
Dear God ! the very houses seem asleep ; 
And all that mighty heart is lying still ! 

CONCLUSION. 

If these brief Records, by the Muses' art 
Produced as lonely Nature or the strife 
That animates the scenes of public life 
Inspired, may in thy leisure claim a part ; 
And if these Transcripts of the private heart 
Have gained a sanction from thy falling tears ; 
Then  repent not. But my soul hath fears 
Breathed from eternity ; for as a dart 
Cleaves the blank air, Life flies : now every day 
Is but a glimmering spoke in the swift wheel 
Of the revolving week. Away, away, 
All fitful cares, all transitory zeal ! 
So timely Grace the immortal wing may heal, 
And honour rest upon the senseless clay. 

 This line alludes to Sonnets which will be found in

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

PART III. 

Though the bold wings of Poesy affect 
The clouds, and wheel around the mountain tops 
Rejoicing, from her loftiest height she drops 
Well pleased to skim the plain with wild flowers 
deckt, 
Or muse in solemn grove whose shades protect 
The lingering dew — there steals along, or stops 
Watching the least small bird that round her hops, 
Or creeping worm, with sensitive respect. 
Her functions are they therefore less divine, 
Her thoughts less deep, or void of grave intent 
Her simplest fancies ? Should that fear be thine, 
Aspiring Votary, ere thy hand present 
One offering, kneel before her modest shrine, 
With brow in penitential sorrow bent ! 

OXFORD, MAY , . 
Ye sacred Nurseries of blooming Youth ! 
In whose collegiate shelter England's Flowers 
Expand, enjoying through their vernal hours 
The air of liberty, the light of truth ; 
Much have ye suffered from Time's gnawing tooth : 
Yet, ye spires of Oxford ! domes and towers ! 
Gardens and groves ! your presence overpowers 
The soberness of reason ; till, in sooth, 
Transformed, and rushing on a bold exchange, 
I slight my own beloved Cam, to range 
Where silver Isis leads my stripling feet ; 
Pace the long avenue, or glide adown 
The stream-like windings of that glorious street — 
An eager Novice robed in fluttering gown ! 

OXFORD, MAY , . 
Shame on this faithless heart ! that could allow 
Such transport, though but for a moment's space ; 
Not while — to aid the spirit of the place — 
The crescent moon clove with its glittering prow 
The clouds, or night-bird sang from shady bough ; 
But in plain daylight : — She, too, at my side, 
Who, with her heart's experience satisfied, 
Maintains inviolate its slightest vow ! 
Sweet Fancy ! other gifts must I receive ; 
Proofs of a higher sovereignty I claim ; 
Take from her brow the withering flowers of eve, 
And to that brow life's morning wreath restore : 
Let her be comprehended in the frame 
Of these illusions, or they please no more. 

RECOLLECTION OF THE PORTRAIT OF KING HENRY 
EIGHTH, TRINITY LODGE, CAMBRIDGE. 
The imperial Stature, the colossal stride, 
Are yet before me ; yet do I behold 
The broad full visage, chest of amplest mould, 
The vestments 'broidered with barbaric pride : 
And lo ! a poniard, at the Monarch's side, 
Hangs ready to be grasped in sympathy 
With the keen threatenings of that fulgent eye. 
Below the white-rimmed bonnet, far-descried. 
Who trembles now at thy capricious mood ? 
'Mid those surrounding Worthies, haughty Kh g, 
We rather think, with grateful mind sedate, 
How Providence educeth, from the spring 
Of lawless will, unlooked-for streams of good, 
Which neither force shall check nor time abate ! 

ON THE DEATH OF HIS MAJESTY (GEORGE THE THIRD) 
Ward of the Law ! — dread Shadow of a King ! 
Whose realm had dwindled to one stately room ; 
Whose universe was gloom immersed in gloom, 
Darkness as thick as life o'er life could fling, 
Save haply for some feeble glimmering 
Of Faith and Hope— if thou, by nature's doom, 
Gently hast sunk into the quiet tomb, 
Why should we bend in grief, to sorrow cling, 
When thankfulness were best?— Fresh-flowing tears 
Or, where tears flow not, sigh succeeding sigh, 
Yield to such after-thought the sole reply 
Which justly it can claim. The Nation hears 
In this deep knell, silent for threescore years, 
An unexampled voice of awful memory ! 

JUNE, . 
Fame tells of groves — from England far away — 
 Groves that inspire the Nightingale to trill 
And modulate, with subtle reach of skill 
Elsewhere unmatched, her ever- varying lay ; 
Such bold report I venture to gainsay : 
For I have heard the quire of Richmond biil 
Chanting, with indefatigable bill, 
Strains that recalled to mind a distant day ; 
When, haply under shade of that same wood, 
And scarcely conscious of the dashing oars 
Plied steadily between those willowy shores, 
The sweet-souled Poet of the Seasons stood — 
Listening, and listening long, in rapturous mood, 
Ye heavenly Birds ! to your Progenitors. 

 Wallacliia is the country alluded to.

Lnd neighbours rest together, here confound

TO THE TORRENT AT THE DEVIL'S BRIDGE, NORTH 
WALES . 
How art thou named \ In search of what strange land 
From what huge height, descending % Can such force 
Of waters issue from a British source, 
Or hath not Pindus fed thee, where the band 
Of Patriots scoop their freedom out, with hand 
Desperate as thine ? Or come the incessant shocks 
From that young Stream, that smites the throbbing 
rocks 
Of Viamala ? There I seem to stand, 
As in life's morn ; permitted to behold, 
From the dread chasm, woods climbing above woods, 
In pomp that fades not ; everlasting snows ; 
And skies that ne'er relinquish their repose ; 
Such power possess the family of floods 
Over the minds of Poets, young or old ! 

IN THE WOODS OF RYDAL. 
Wild Redbreast ! hadst thou at Jemima's lip 
Pecked, as at mine, thus boldly, Love might say, 
A half-blown rose had tempted thee to sip 
Its glistening dews ; but hallowed is the clay 
Which the Muse warms ; and I, whose head is grey, 
Am not unworthy of thy fellowship ; 
Nor could I let one thought — one motion — slip 
That might thy sylvan confidence betray. 
For are we not all His without whose care 
Vouchsafed no sparrow falleth to the ground  
"Who gives his Angels wings to speed through air, 
And rolls the planets through the blue profound ; 
Then peck or perch, fond Flutterer ! nor forbear 
To trust a Poet in still musings bound. 

When Philoctetes in the Lemnian isle 
Like a Form sculptured on a monument 
Lay couched ; on him or his dread bow unbent 
Some wild Bird oft might settle and beguile 
The rigid features of a transient smile, 
Disperse the tear, or to the sigh give vent, 
Slackening the pains of ruthless banishment 
From his lov'd home, and from heroic toil. 
And trust that spiritual Creatures round us move, 
Griefs to allay which Reason cannot heal ; 
Yea, veriest reptiles have sufficed to prove 
To fettered wretchedness, that no Bastile 
Is deep enough to exclude the light of love, 
Though man for brother man has ceased to feel,

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

While Anna's peers and early playmates tread, 
In freedom, mountain-turf and river's marge ; 
Or float with music in the festal barge ; 
Rein the proud steed, or through the dance are led ; 
Her doom it is to press a weary bed — 
Till oft her guardian Angel, to some charge 
More urgent called, will stretch his wings at large, 
And friends too rarely prop the languid head. 
Yet, helped by Genius — untired comforter, 
The presence even of a stuffed Owl for her 
Can cheat the time ; sending her fancy out 
To ivied castles and to moonlight skies, 
Though he can neither stir a plume, nor shout ; 
Nor veil, with restless film, his staring eyes. 

TO THE CUCKOO. 
Not the whole warbling grove in concert heard 
When sunshine follows shower, the breast can thrill 
Like the first summons, Cuckoo ! of thy bill, 
With its twin notes inseparably paired. 
The captive 'mid damp vaults' unsunned, unaired, 
Measuring the periods of his lonely doom, 
That cry can reach ; and to the sick man's room 
Sends gladness, by no languid smile declared. 
The lordly eagle-race through hostile search 
May perish; time may come when never more 
The wilderness shall hear the lion roar; 
But, long as cock shall crow from household perch 
To rouse the dawn, soft gales shall speed thy wing, 
And thy erratic voice be faithful to the Spring ! 

TO 

[Miss not the occasion : by the foreloclc take 
That subtile Power, the never-halting Time, 
Lest a mere moment's putting-off should make 
Mischance almost as heavy as a crime.] 
" Wait, prithee, wait !" this answer Lesbia threw 
Forth to her Dove, and took no further heed. 
Her eye was busy, while her fingers flew 
Across the harp, with soul engrossing speed ; 
Butfrom that bondage when her thoughts were freed 
She rose, and toward the close-shut casement drew, 
Whence the poor unregarded Favourite, true 
To old affections, had been heard to plead 
With flapping wing for entrance. What a shriek 
Forced from that voice so lately tuned to a strain 
Of harmony ! — a shriek of terror, pain, 
And self-reproach ! for, from aloft, a Kite [beak 
Pounced, — and the Dove, which from its ruthless 
She could not rescue, perished in her sight ! 


THE INFANT M- 

Unquiet Childhood here by special grace 
Forgets her nature, opening like a flower 
That neither feeds nor wastes its vital power 
In painful struggles. Months each other chase, 
And nought untunes that Infant's voice ; no trace ii 
Of fretful temper sullies her pure cheek; 
Prompt, lively, self-sufficing, yet so meek 
That one enrapt with gazing on her face 
(Which even the placid innocence of death 
Could scarcely make more placid, heaven more 
bright) 
Might learn to picture, for the eye of faith, 
The Virgin, as she shone with kindred light; 
A nursling couched upon her mother's knee, 
Beneath some shady palm of Galilee. 

TO , IN HER SEVENTIETH YEAR. 
Such age how beautiful ! Lady bright, 
Whose mortal lineaments seem all refined 
By favouring Nature and a saintly Mind 
To something purer and more exquisite [sight. 
Than flesh and blood ; whene'er thou meet'st n;y 
When I behold thy blanched unwithered cheek, 
Thy temples fringed with locks of gleaming white, 
And head that droops because the soul is meek, 
Thee with the welcome Snowdrop I compare ; 
That child of winter, prompting thoughts that climb 
From desolation toward the genial prime ; 
Or with the Moon conquering earth's mist) air, 
And filling more and more with crystal light 
As pensive Evening deepens into night. 

to rotha q . 
Rotha, my Spiritual Child ! this head was grey 
When at the sacred font for thee I stood ; 
Pledged till thou reach the verge of womanhood, 
And shalt become thy own sufficient stay : 
Too late, I feel, sweet Orphan ! was the day 
For stedfast hope the contract to fulfil ; 
Yet shall my blessing hover o'er thee still, 
Embodied in the music of this Lay, [Stream i 
Breathed forth beside the peaceful mountain 
Whose murmur soothed thy languid Mother's ear 
After her throes, this Stream of name more dear 
Since thou dost bear it, — a memorial theme 
For others ; for thy future self, a spell 
To summon fancies out of Time's dark cell. 

 The river Rotha, that flows into Windermere from the 
Lakes of Grasmere and Rydal.

A TRADITION OF OKEfi HILL IN DARLEY DALE, 
DERBYSHIRE. 
'Tis said that to the brow of yon fair hill 
Two Brothers clomb, and, turning face from face, 
Nor one look more exchanging, grief to still 
Or feed, each planted on that lofty place 
A chosen Tree ; then, eager to fulfil 
Their courses, like two new-born rivers, they 
In opposite directions urged their way 
Down from the far-seen mount. No blast might kill 
Or blight that fond memorial ; — the trees grew, 
And now entwine their arms ; but ne'er again 
Embraced those Brothers upon earth's wide plain; 
Nor aught of mutual joy or sorrow knew 
Until their spirits mingled in the sea 
That to itself takes all, Eternity. 

FILIAL PIETY. 
(ON THE WAYSIDE BETWEEN PBESTON AND LIVERPOOL.) 
Untouched through all severity of cold ; 
Inviolate, whate'er the cottage hearth 
Might need for comfort, or for festal mirth ; 
That Pile of Turf is half a century old : 
Yes, Traveller ! fifty winters have been told 
Since suddenly the dart of death went forth 
'Gainst him who raised it, — his last work on earth: 
Thence has it, with the Son, so strong a hold 
Upon his Father's memory, that his hands, 
Through reverence, touch it only to repair 
Its waste.— Though crumbling with each breath of air, 
In annual renovation thus it stands — 
Rude Mausoleum ! but wrens nestle there, 
And red-breasts warble when sweet sounds are rare. 

TO THE AUTHOR'S PORTRAIT. 
[Painted at Rydal Mount, by W. Pickefsgill, Esq., for St. John's 
College, Cambridge.] 
Go, faithful Portrait ! and where long hath knelt 
Margaret, the saintly Foundress, take thy place ; 
And, if Time spare the colours for the grace 
Which to the work surpassing skill hath dealt, 
Thou, on thy rock reclined, though kingdoms melt 
And states be torn up by the roots, wilt seem 
To breathe in rural peace, to hear the stream, 
And think and feel as once the Poet felt. 
Whate'er thy fate, those features have not grown 
Unrecognised through many a household tear 
More prompt, more glad, to fall than drops of dew 
By morning shed around a flower half-blown ; 
Tears of delight, that testified how true 
To life thou art, and, in thy truth, how deal- ! 

 

POEMS OF THE IMAGINATION. 

Why art thou silent ! Is thy love a plant 
Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air 
Of absence withers what was once so fair ? 
Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant ? 
Yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant — 
Bound to thy service with unceasing care, 
The mind's least generous wish a mendicant 
For nought but what thy happiness could spare. 
Speak — though this soft warm heart, once free to 
hold 
A thousand tender pleasures, thine and mine, 
Be left more desolate, more dreary cold 
Than a forsaken bird's-nest filled with snow 
'Mid its own bush of leafless eglantine — 
Speak, that my torturing doubts their end may know ! 

TO B. R. HAYBON, ON SEEING HIS PICTURE OF NAPO- 
LEON BUONAPARTE ON THE ISLANB OF ST. HELENA. 
Haydon ! let worthier judges praise the skill 
Here by thy pencil shown in truth of lines 
And charm of colours ; / applaud those signs 
Of thought, that give the true poetic thrill ; 
That unencumbered whole of blank and still, 
Sky without cloud — ocean without a wave ; 
And the one Man that laboured to enslave 
The World, sole-standing high on the bare hill — 
Back turned, arms folded, the unapparent face 
Tinged, we may fancy, in this dreary place 
With light reflected from the invisible sun 
Set, like his fortunes ; but not set for aye 
Like them. The unguilty Power pursues his way, 
And before Mm doth dawn perpetual run. 

A Poet I — He hath put his heart to school, 
Nor dares to move unpropped upon the staff 
Which Art hath lodged within his hand — must laugh 
By precept only, and shed tears by rule. 
Thy Art be Nature ; the live current quaff, 
And let the groveller sip his stagnant pool, 
In fear that else, when Critics grave and cool 
Have killed him, Scorn should write his epitaph. 
How does the Meadow-flower its bloom unfold ? 
Because the lovely little flower is free 
Down to its root, and, in that freedom, bold ; 
And so the grandeur of the Forest-tree 
Comes not by casting in a formal mould, 
But from its own divine vitality. 

The most alluring clouds that mount the sky 
Owe to a troubled element their forms, 
Their hues to sunset. If with raptured eye 
We watch their splendor, shall we covet storms, 
And wish the Lord of day his slow decline 
Would hasten, that such pomp may float on high! 
Behold, already they forget to shine, 
Dissolve — and leave to him who gazed a sigh. 
Not loth to thank each moment for its boon 
Of pure delight, come whencesoe'er it may, 
Peace let us seek, — to stedfast things attune 
Calm expectations, leaving to the gay 
And volatile their love of transient bowers, 
The house that cannot pass away be ours. 

ON A PORTRAIT OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON 
UPON THE FIELD OF WATERLOO, BY HAYDON. 
By Art's bold privilege Warrior and War-horse 
stand 
On ground yet strewn with their last battle's wreck ; 
Let the Steed glory while his Master's hand 
Lies fixed for ages on his conscious neck ; 
But by the Chieftain's look, though at his side 
Hangs that day's treasured sword,how firm a check 
Is given to triumph and all human pride ! 
Yon trophied Mound shrinks to a shadowy speck 
In his calm presence ! Him the mighty deed 
Elates not, brought far nearer the grave's rest, 
As shows that time-worn face, for he such seed 
Has sown as yields, we trust, the fruit of fame 
In Heaven ; hence no one blushes for thy name, 
Conqueror, mid some sad thoughts, divinely blest ! 

COMPOSED ON A MAY MORNING, . 
Life with yon Lambs, like day, is just begun, 
Yet Nature seems to them a heavenly guide. 
Does joy approach % they meet the coming tide; 
And sullenness avoid, as now they shun 
Pale twilight's lingering glooms, — and in the sun 
Couch near their dams, with quiet satisfied ; 
Or gambol — each with his shadow at his side, 
Varying its shape wherever he may run. 
As they from turf yet hoar with sleepy dew 
All turn, and court the shining and the green., 
Where herbs look up, and opening flowers are seen ] 
Why to God's goodness cannot We be true, 
And so, His gifts and promises between, 
Feed to the last on pleasures ever new ?
